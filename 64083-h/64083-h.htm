THE RENAISSANCE OF PARENTHOOD
</h2>

<p class="aut">
MARGARET C. ANDERSON
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">here</span> seems to be a kind of renaissance of motherhood in the air.
Ellen Key has just done a book with that title which has come to
us too late to be reviewed adequately in this issue; Mrs. Gasquoine
Hartley has written <em>The Age of Mother Power</em> which will be brought
out in the fall; and in Shaw&rsquo;s new volume of plays (<em>Misalliance</em>,
<em>Fanny&rsquo;s First Play</em> and <em>The Dark Lady of the Sonnets</em>) there is a
preface of over a hundred pages devoted to a discussion of parents and
children which says some of the most refreshing and important things
about that relationship I have ever read.
</p>

<p>
The home, as such, is rapidly losing its old functions&mdash;perhaps it
is more accurate to say that it is changing its standards of functioning,
and that the present distress merely heralds in a wonderful new conception
of family potentiality. But a generalization of this sort can
be disputed by any family egotist, so let&rsquo;s get down to particulars. It&rsquo;s
all right for the enlightened of the older generation to preach violently
that the family is a humbug, as Shaw does; that the child should have
all the rights of any other human being, and that there is nothing so
futile or so stupid as to try to &ldquo;control&rdquo; your children. It&rsquo;s not only
all right; it&rsquo;s glorious! But what I&rsquo;m more interested in, still being of
the age that must classify as &ldquo;daughter,&rdquo; is this:&mdash;what are &ldquo;the children&rdquo;
themselves doing about it? Have their rebellions been anything
more than complaints; have they made any real stand for liberty; have
they proved themselves worthy of the Shavian championship?
</p>

<p>
Well&mdash;I got hold recently of a human document which answered
these questions quite in the affirmative. It was a rather startling thing
because, while it offered nothing new on the theory side of the matter,
it showed the theory in thoughtful action&mdash;which, for all the talk on
the subject, is still rare. It was a letter of some twenty pages written
by a girl to her mother at the time of a domestic climax when all the
bonds of family affection, family idealism and obligation were tending
to smother the human truth of the situation, as the girl put it. She
was in her early twenties; she had a sister two or three years younger,
and both of them had reached at least a sort of economic independence.
She had come to the conclusion, after a good many years of rebellion,
<a id="page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a>
that the whole fabric of their family life was wrong; and since it was
impossible to talk the thing out sensibly&mdash;because, as in all families
where the children grow up without being given the necessary revaluations,
real talk is no more possible than it is between uncongenial
strangers&mdash;she had decided to discuss it in a letter. That medium does
away with the patronage of the parents&rsquo; refusal to listen seriously:&mdash;that
&ldquo;Oh, come now, what do you know about these things?&rdquo; If the
child has anything interesting to say, if he puts any of his rebellion into
his writing, the chances are that the parent will read the letter through;
and the result is that he&rsquo;ll know more about his child than he has
learned in all the years they&rsquo;ve been trying to talk with each other and
not succeeding. I&rsquo;m enthusiastic about this kind of family correspondence;
it&rsquo;s good training in expression and it clears the air&mdash;jolts the
&ldquo;heads&rdquo; of the family into realizing that the thinking and planning are
not all on one side. I once did it myself to my father&mdash;put ten pages
of closely-written argument on his office desk (so that he&rsquo;d open it
with the same impersonality given to a business communication), in
which I explained why I wanted to go away from home and learn to
<em>work</em>, and why I thought such a course was an intelligent one. The
letter accomplished what no amount of talking would have done, because
in our talk we rarely got beyond the &ldquo;Oh, now, you&rsquo;re just a little
excited, it will look different in the morning&rdquo; stage. Father said it
was rather a shock to him because he didn&rsquo;t know I had ever figured
things out to that extent; but we always understood each other better
after that.
</p>

<p>
However&mdash;not to get lost in personalities&mdash;this is the letter the
girl showed me and which she allows me to quote from partially:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
If we are to continue living together in any sort of happiness and growth
the entire basis of our present life will have to be changed. We can do it if
we&rsquo;re brave enough to do what people usually do only in books:&mdash;face the
fact squarely that our family life is and has been a failure, and set about to
remedy it. It will mean an entire change of home conditions, and these are
the terms of the new arrangement:
</p>

<p>
When I said to you the other day that things would have to go <em>my</em> way
now, you were horrified at the conceit of it. To get to facts, there&rsquo;s no conceit
in it&mdash;because my way is simply the practise of not imposing one&rsquo;s will
upon other people. I made the remark merely as a common sense suggestion,
and made it out of a seriousness that is desperate. I say &ldquo;desperate&rdquo; because
I mean that literally: the situation isn&rsquo;t a question of a mere temporary adjustment&mdash;just
some sort of superficial arrangement so that we can get on pleasantly
for a while before the next outbreak comes. The plans Betty and I
have discussed have been made in the interest of our whole future lives:&mdash;whether
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
we&rsquo;re going to submit (either by surrender or compromise or by
just drifting along and not doing anything) to an existence of bickering, nagging,
hours spent in the discussion of non-essentials, hideous lack of harmony&mdash;the
whole stupid programme we&rsquo;ve watched working for years and achieving
nothing but unhappiness, folly, and a terrible &ldquo;human waste.&rdquo; You ask us
to continue in your way; but from at least three points of view that way has
been a failure. I ask you to adopt my way&mdash;which has not yet failed. That&rsquo;s
why I say it&rsquo;s not conceit, but common sense.
</p>

<p>
My way is simply this: that we three can live together and work in peace
and harmony if this awful bugbear of Authority is dropped out of the scheme.
Each of us must go her own way; we&rsquo;re all different, and there&rsquo;s no reason
why one should impose her authority on the lives of the others. You say that
you should because you&rsquo;re our mother. But that&rsquo;s the thing I want to discuss.
</p>

<p>
Motherhood isn&rsquo;t infallibility. If a woman is a wise woman she&rsquo;s a wise
mother; if she&rsquo;s a foolish woman she&rsquo;s a foolish mother. Because you&rsquo;re our
mother doesn&rsquo;t mean that you must always be right; before being a mother
you&rsquo;re a human being, and any human being is likely to be wrong. To get
down to brutal facts, we think you are <em>not</em> right about the whole thing. We&rsquo;ve
thought so for years, but now it&rsquo;s come to the time when our thinking must be
put into action. We&rsquo;re no longer children; but even as mere infants we
thought these things&mdash;without having the right to express them. What I&rsquo;m
trying to do now is to express them not as a daughter, but quite impersonally
as a human being, as a mere friend, a sister, or anyone who might come to
you stating that she believed with all her soul that you were wrong, and also
stating, just as impersonally, that she wouldn&rsquo;t think of modeling her line of
conduct after that pattern which appeared to her so wrong. We <em>must</em> face the
facts; if you do that squarely it doesn&rsquo;t seem so bad, and you stop flinching
about it. You get to the point where you&rsquo;re not afraid to face them boldly,
and then you begin to <em>construct</em>. And this is the only way to clear up the
kind of rottenness and decay that flourishes in our family life.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s in the interest of this achievement that I say the thing a girl isn&rsquo;t
supposed to say to her mother&mdash;namely, that Betty and I will not any longer
subscribe to the things you expect us to. The fact to face just as quickly as
possible is this: it&rsquo;s the starting point. When you realize that we feel it&rsquo;s a
question of doing this or laying a foundation for lives that are just <em>half</em> lives&mdash;hideous
perverted things which miss all the beauty that you can put into the
short life given you&mdash;I think you&rsquo;ll see how serious we are. We&rsquo;re at least
two intelligent human beings, if we&rsquo;re nothing else. And why should you ask
or expect that we&rsquo;ll submit to a system which to us means stupidity, misery,
pettiness&mdash;all those things which we&rsquo;ve seen working out for years and which,
being at least intelligent, we want to keep away from?
</p>

<p>
That much settled, we can continue to live together in just one way&mdash;as
three sisters or friends; the motherhood, in so far as it means authority or an
attempt to mould us to <em>your</em> way, must be eliminated. A complete new family
idealism can be built on such a basis. You will say that it&rsquo;s an abnormal basis
for any mother to accept. Of course it is; but the situation is abnormal, and
the orthodox remedies aren&rsquo;t applicable.
</p>

<p>
The reason I say the situation is abnormal is this: usually when a mother
objects to her daughters&rsquo; behavior it is on some definite basis of opposing the
things they <em>do</em>&mdash;like going to too many parties or falling in love with the
wrong man. You have very little fault to find with the things we do. Your
objections are on a basis of what we <em>are</em>&mdash;or, rather, of what we <em>are not</em>: that
we are not orthodox, that we are not hypocrites, that we are not the kind of
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
daughters the Victorians approved of. &ldquo;Hypocrites&rdquo; will sound paradoxical;
but you have confessed that you would rather have us lie to you than to disagree
with you; that you would rather have us be sentimental about &ldquo;the way
a girl should treat her mother&rdquo; than to learn how we ought to treat ourselves.
You call that being &ldquo;respectful&rdquo; and think that harmony is possible only under
such conditions. We call it being &ldquo;insulting,&rdquo; and think that it&rsquo;s the one sure
way of destroying any chance of harmony. If we respect you it must be because
we think you worthy of the truth: anything else is degrading to both
sides.
</p>

<p>
You&rsquo;ll say you can&rsquo;t be satisfied to live with us and not give advice and
all the other things that are part of a mother&rsquo;s duty. You may give all the
advice you want to; the keynote of the new situation will be that we&rsquo;ll take the
advice if we believe it&rsquo;s right; if not we&rsquo;ll ignore it, just as a man ignores his
friend&rsquo;s advice when he feels it to be wrong. Of course the wise person
doesn&rsquo;t give much advice; he simply lives his life the best way he knows how.
That&rsquo;s the only bid he can make for emulation. If we tell you that we don&rsquo;t
approve of the creed you have made you mustn&rsquo;t be surprised if we try to
formulate one of our own. There&rsquo;s no reason for us to ask you to change
just because we&rsquo;re your daughters. You must do as you believe. But you
must grant us the same privilege.
</p>

<p>
We disagree about fundamentals. If our beliefs were merely the vague,
unformed ideas of children you might try to change them. But it&rsquo;s too late
now. So we can live together harmoniously only if we give up the foolish
attempts at &ldquo;influencing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;re not living three generations ago. We&rsquo;ve had Shaw since then,
and parents and children aren&rsquo;t doing the insulting things to each other they
used to do. Among intelligent people some of the old issues can never raise
their heads again. And so, it&rsquo;s for you to decide:&mdash;whether we shall build on
the new foundation together or separately.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
It might be a play; it&rsquo;s certainly rather good for reality. And
what happened? The mother refused to &ldquo;accept the terms&rdquo;&mdash;which is
not surprising, perhaps; and the household broke up into two establishments
with results that will disappoint the conservative who thinks
those girls should have been soundly beaten. The first wrench of it,
the girl said, reminded her of George&rsquo;s parting with Marion in <em>Tono-Bungay</em>:&mdash;that
sense of belonging to each other immensely, that &ldquo;profound
persuasion of irreparable error&rdquo; in the midst of what seemed
profoundly right. &ldquo;Nothing is simple,&rdquo; Wells wrote in that connection;
&ldquo;every wrong done has a certain justice in it, and every good
deed has dregs of evil.&rdquo; But the girl and her mother have learned to be
friends as a result of that break, and the latter will tell you now that
it was the right thing to have done.
</p>

<p>
The preface to <em>Misalliance</em> has such a wealth of quotable things
in it that the only way to get them appreciated is to quote. Shaw has
said much of this before, but it is all so valuable that it ought to be
shouted from the housetops:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
The people against whom children are wholly unprotected are those
who devote themselves to the very mischievous and cruel sort of abortion
which is called bringing up a child in the way it should go. Now nobody
knows the way a child should go.
</p>

<p>
What is a child? An experiment. A fresh attempt to produce the just
man made perfect: that is, to make humanity divine. And you will vitiate the
experiment if you make the slightest attempt to abort it into some fancy figure
of your own: for example, your notion of a good man or a womanly woman.
If you treat it as a little wild beast to be tamed, or as a pet to be played with,
or even as a means to save you trouble and to make money for you (and
these are our commonest ways), it may fight its way through in spite of you
and save its soul alive; for all its instincts will resist you, and possibly be
strengthened in the resistance; but if you begin with its own holiest aspirations,
and suborn them for your own purposes, then there is hardly any limit
to the mischief you may do.
</p>

<p>
Francis Place tells us that his father always struck his children when he
found one within his reach.... Francis records the habit with bitterness,
having reason to thank his stars that his father respected the inside of
his head whilst cuffing the outside of it; and this made it easy for Francis to
do yeoman&rsquo;s service to his country as that rare and admirable thing, a Free-thinker:
the only sort of thinker, I may remark, whose thoughts, and consequently
whose religious convictions, command any respect.
</p>

<p>
Now Mr. Place, senior, would be described by many as a bad father;
and I do not contend that he was a conspicuously good one. But as compared
with the conventionally good father who deliberately imposes himself
on his son as god; who takes advantage of childish credulity and parent worship
to persuade his son that what he approves of is right and what he disapproves
of is wrong; who imposes a corresponding conduct on the child by a
system of prohibitions and penalties, rewards and eulogies, for which he
claims divine sanction; compared to this sort of abortionist and monster maker,
I say, Place appears almost as a Providence.
</p>

<p>
A gentleman once wrote to me and said, with an obvious conviction
that he was being most reasonable and high minded, that the only thing he
beat his children for was failure in perfect obedience and perfect truthfulness.
On these attributes, he said, he must insist. As one of them is not a virtue at
all, and the other is the attribute of a god, one can imagine what the lives of
this gentleman&rsquo;s children would have been if it had been possible for him to
live down to his monstrous and foolish pretensions.
</p>

<p>
The cruelty (of beating a child) must be whitewashed by a moral excuse,
and a pretense of reluctance. It must be for the child&rsquo;s good. The assailant
must say &ldquo;This hurts me more than it hurts you.&rdquo; There must be hypocrisy
as well as cruelty.
</p>

<p>
The most excusable parents are those who try to correct their own faults in
their offspring. The parent who says to his child: &ldquo;I am one of the successes
of the Almighty: therefore imitate me in every particular or I will have the
skin off your back&rdquo; (a quite common attitude) is a much more absurd figure
than the man who, with a pipe in his mouth, thrashes his boy for smoking.
</p>

<p>
If you must hold yourself up to your children as an object lesson (which
is not at all necessary), hold yourself up as a warning and not as an example.
But you had much better let the child&rsquo;s character alone. If you once allow
yourself to regard a child as so much material for you to manufacture into any
shape that happens to suit your fancy you are defeating the experiment of the
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
Life Force. You are assuming that the child does not know its own business,
and that you do. In this you are sure to be wrong. The child feels the
drive of the Life Force (often called the Will of God); and you cannot feel it
for him.
</p>

<p>
Most children can be, and many are, hopelessly warped and wasted by
parents who are ignorant and silly enough to suppose that they know what a
human being ought to be, and who stick at nothing in their determination to
force their children into their moulds.
</p>

<p>
Experienced parents, when children&rsquo;s rights are preached to them, very
naturally ask whether children are to be allowed to do what they like. The best
reply is to ask whether adults are to be allowed to do what they like. The two
cases are the same. The adult who is nasty is not allowed to do what he likes:
neither can the child who likes to be nasty. There is no difference in principle
between the rights of a child and those of an adult: the difference in their
cases is one of circumstance.
</p>

<p>
Most working folk today either send their children to day schools or
turn them out of doors. This solves the problem for the parents. It does not
solve it for the children, any more than the tethering of a goat in the field or
the chasing of an unlicensed dog in the streets solves it for the goat or the dog;
but it shows that in no class are people willing to endure the society of their
children, and consequently it is an error to believe that the family provides
children with edifying adult society, or that the family is a social unit.
</p>

<p>
The family is in that, as in so many other respects, a humbug. Old people
and young people cannot walk at the same pace without distress and final
loss of health to one of the parties.... And since our system is nevertheless
to pack them all into the same house and pretend that they are happy,
and that this particular sort of happiness is the foundation of virtue, it is
found that in discussing family life we never speak of actual adults or actual
children, or of realities of any sort, but always of ideals such as The Home, a
Mother&rsquo;s Influence, a Father&rsquo;s Care, Filial Piety, Duty, Affection, Family Life,
etc., etc., which are no doubt very comforting phrases, but which beg the question
of what a home and a mother&rsquo;s influence and a father&rsquo;s care and so forth
really come to.... Women who cannot bear to be separated from their
pet dogs send their children to boarding school cheerfully. They may say
and even believe that in allowing their children to leave home they are sacrificing
themselves for their children&rsquo;s good.... But to allege that children
are better continually away from home is to give up the whole popular
sentimental theory of the family....
</p>

<p>
If you compel an adult and a child to live in one another&rsquo;s company
either the adult or the child will be miserable. There is nothing whatever unnatural
or wrong or shocking in this fact, and there is no harm in it if only it
be sensibly faced and provided for. The mischief that it does at present is
produced by our efforts to ignore it, or to smother it under a heap of sentimental
and false pretenses.
</p>

<p>
The child&rsquo;s rights, being clearly those of any other human being, are
summed up in the right to live.... And the rights of society over it
clearly extend to requiring it to qualify itself to live in society without wasting
other people&rsquo;s time....
</p>

<p>
We must reconcile education with liberty. We must find out some means
of making men workers and, if need be, warriors, without making them
slaves.
</p>

<p>
In dealing with children what is needed is not logic but sense.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
A child should begin to assert itself early, and shift for itself more and
more not only in washing and dressing itself, but in opinions and conduct.... And
what is a tyrant? Quite simply a person who says to another
person, young or old, &ldquo;You shall do as I tell you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Children are extremely cruel without intending it; and in ninety-nine cases
out of a hundred the reason is that they do not conceive their elders as having
any human feeling. Serve the elders right, perhaps, for posing as superhuman!
The penalty of the imposter is not that he is found out (he very seldom is)
but that he is taken for what he pretends to be and treated as such.
</p>

<p>
The family ideal is a humbug and a nuisance: one might as reasonably
talk of the barrack ideal, or the forecastle ideal, or any other substitution of
the machinery of social for the end of it, which must always be the fullest
and most capable life: in short, the most Godly life.
</p>

<p>
Even apart from its insufferable pretensions, the family needs hearty
discrediting; for there is hardly any vulnerable part of it that could not be
amputated with advantage.
</p>

<p>
Do not for a moment suppose that uncultivated people are merely indifferent
to high and noble qualities. They hate them malignantly....
</p>

<p>
Whether the risks to which liberty exposes us are moral or physical our
right to liberty involves the right to run them. A man who is not free to risk
his neck as an aviator or his soul as a heretic is not free at all; and the right to
liberty begins, not at the age of 21 years, but of 21 seconds.

You may have as much fun at Shaw&rsquo;s expense as you want on
the grounds that he has never had to train a child and therefore doesn&rsquo;t
know the difficulties. But if you want to laugh last don&rsquo;t read this
preface or the play that follows it, because he will make a laughing-stock
or a convert of you as surely as he will prove that he is far cleverer
than you can ever hope to be.
</p>

<p>
Shaw and Ellen Key preach practically the same doctrine about
the home; both are temperamentally incapable of Charlotte Perkins
Gilman&rsquo;s programme&mdash;education outside the home: Shaw because the
school is as big a humbug as the family, and Miss Key because &ldquo;even
if institutions can thus rough-plane the material that is to become a
member of society, nevertheless they cannot&mdash;if they take in the major
part of the child&rsquo;s education&mdash;accomplish that which is needed first
of all if we are to lift ourselves to a higher spiritual plane in an economically
just society: they cannot deepen the emotional life.&rdquo; Her insistence
is strongly upon the education of the feelings as the most
important factor in the soul-life. In her vision of the renaissance of
motherhood she begins with Nietzsche&rsquo;s dictum that &ldquo;a time will come
when men will think of nothing except education.&rdquo; Not that any one
can be educated <em>to</em> motherliness; but that our sentimentalization of
motherhood as the ever holy, ever infallible power, must be abandoned,
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
and a quality of intelligent mother-power cultivated by definite
courses of training which she lays out in detail.
</p>

<p>
In view of the number of homes I know of that come legitimately
under the Shaw denunciation I feel sometimes that any socialization
of home life is more hopeful than an attempt to remodel the hopeless
conditions inside the home. Regard the parents you know&mdash;the
great mass of them outside the exceptions that encourage you to believe
spasmodically in the beauty and noble need of parenthood. If
they are not cruel or stupid or ignorant or smug or righteous or tyrannical
or dishonest or unimaginative or weak or quiet ineffectual, they
are something else just as bad. It has come to the point where a good
parent is as hard to find as an honest man.
</p>

<p>
Very seriously, however, there is hope in the situation&mdash;there is
renaissance in the air. And it has its foundation in the sensible and
healthy (though so far only tacit) admission that it doesn&rsquo;t matter so
much what your child becomes as that he shall <em>become something</em>! You
can&rsquo;t do much with him, anyhow, and you may as well face it. You
can give him, during his first few years, the kind of foundation you
think will help him; and for the rest of the time you can do only one
thing that he will really need from you: you can develop your own
personality as richly as you want him to develop his. You can refuse
to worry about him&mdash;since that does neither of you any good&mdash;and
thereby save stores of energy that he may draw upon for <em>your mutual
benefit</em>. It becomes a sort of game for two, instead of the uninteresting
kind in which one player is given all the advantages. Compared with
it the old-fashioned game in which the mother sacrificed everything,
suffered everything, wore herself out trying to help her child win, looks
not only very unfair and very unnecessary, but very <em>wasteful</em>. And
have you ever noticed how the man who sentimentalizes about the
wonderful mothers we used to have&mdash;his own in particular&mdash;is the one
whose life is lived at the opposite pole of the mother&rsquo;s wise direction?
</p>

<p>
If you disagree with all this, there is still one other method by
which you may produce a child who will be a credit to himself and to
society. You may be so utterly stupid and wrong-headed that he will
rebel to the point of becoming something different. If you prefer
this course no one need worry much about your child, because he&rsquo;ll
probably found a system of child education that will cause him to be
famous; and if you have a daughter, she&rsquo;ll probably become a Montessori.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
The new home is a recognition that the child is not the only factor
in society that needs educating. It assumes that no one&rsquo;s education
is finished just because he&rsquo;s been made a parent. It means that
we can all go on being educated together. It means the elimination of
all kinds of domestic follies&mdash;for one, the ghastly embarrassment of
growing up to discover that you&rsquo;re different from the rest of your family,
and for that reason something of a criminal. It means the kind of
understanding that develops a child&rsquo;s feeling instead of suppressing
it, so that he won&rsquo;t be ashamed, for instance, of having such glorious
things as dreams and visions. It means artistic education: and Shaw
says that we all grow up stupid or mad to just the extent to which we
have not been artistically educated.

&ldquo;DES IMAGISTES&rdquo;

<p class="aut">
CHARLES ASHLEIGH
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span> new and well born recruit has been added to the ranks of the
Insurgents. It is true he appeared before we did, but we welcome
him before he welcomes us, and thus are things evened.
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>, <em>The Masses</em>, <em>Poetry</em>, <em>The International</em>&mdash;all bearers
of the sacred fire,&mdash;and now cometh <em>The Glebe</em>, heralding his approach
with the chanting of many-colored strains. And, among the
good things which <em>The Glebe</em> has put forth, is a book of portent: <em>Des
Imagistes</em>.
</p>

<p>
The Imagistes form one of the latest schools, and it is meet that,
before we read their work, we get some idea of their doctrine. Therefore
I transcribe here some statements of representative Imagiste
poets, which I have culled from <em>Poetry</em>, <em>The Egotist</em>, and other sources.
Richard Aldington gives the following rules:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
I. Direct treatment of subject. We convey an emotion by presenting
the object and circumstance of the emotion without comment. For example,
we do not say, &ldquo;O how I admire that exquisite, that beautiful, that&mdash;25 more
adjectives&mdash;woman.&rdquo; But we present that woman, we make an &ldquo;Image&rdquo;
of her, we make the scene convey the emotion....
</p>

<p>
II. As few adjectives as possible.
</p>

<p>
III. A hardness as of cut stone. No slop, no sentimentality. When
people say the Imagiste poems are &ldquo;too hard&rdquo; ... we know we have
done something good.
</p>

<p>
IV. Individuality of rhythm. We make new fashions instead of cutting
our clothes on the old models.
</p>

<p>
V. The exact word. We make quite a heavy stress on that. It is
most important. All great poetry is exact. All the dreariness of nineteenth
century poetry comes from their not quite knowing what they wanted to say
and filling up the gaps with portentous adjectives and idiotic similes.
</p>

<p>
Here is a definition by Ezra Pound which helps us: &ldquo;An Image is that
which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time.&rdquo;
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
The book, <em>Des Imagistes</em>, is an anthology, presumably of Imagist
(let us, once for all, Anglicize the French word and have done with
it) poetry. Yet, one of the foremost imagists, Richard Aldington, in
a critique of this book,&mdash;comparatively modest, owing to the fact
that his own poems formed a sumptuous fraction of the volume,&mdash;says
that five of those whose poems are there included are not true
<a id="page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>
Imagists. These are Cournos, Hueffer, Upward, Joyce, and Cannell.
Mr. Aldington says he doesn&rsquo;t mean that these poems are not beautiful&mdash;on
the contrary, he admires them immensely&mdash;but they are
not, &ldquo;strictly speaking,&rdquo; Imagist poems.
</p>

<p>
I agree that the poems of these five men are beautiful, especially
the <em>I hear an army</em> of James Joyce and the <em>Nocturnes</em> of Skipwith
Cannell; and I also maintain that, all unconsciously, the publishers
of <em>The Glebe</em> have dealt a deadly blow to sectarian Imagism by
including these non-Imagist poems in their anthology. Because, unless
a school can prove that it alone has that unnameable wonder which
excites us to deepest emotional turmoil, and which we call poetry,
it has but little right to isolate itself or to separate its adepts from
the bulk of poets. This may sound sententious, but is, nevertheless,
true. Speak you in whatever mode or meter you will, if you arouse
me to exultation, or to horror, or to the high pitch of any feeling,&mdash;if
in me there is that responsive vibration that only true art can produce&mdash;then
are you a poet.
</p>

<p>
Whitman does it to me. Poe does it to me. Baudelaire and
Henley do it. To all of these there is in me a response. I&rsquo;m awfully
sorry, but that&rsquo;s how it is. I think them all poets.
</p>

<p>
The Imagists believe in the direct presentation of emotion, preferably
in terms of objectivity. They abhor an excess of adjectives,
and, after a satiety of the pompous Victorian stuff, I am much inclined
to sympathize with that tenet of their faith.
</p>

<p>
I wish, however, to make clear my own position, which is the
one that most counts when I am writing. I am an anarchist in poetry:
I recognize no rules, no exclusions.
</p>

<p>
If the expression of a certain thought, vision, or what not, requires
twenty adjectives, then let us have them. If it be better expressed
without adjectives, then let us abjure them&mdash;temporarily.
</p>

<p>
I am myself a poet (whether performance equals desire is doubtful).
My object as a poet is to express the things which are closest
to me. This sounds banal, but is better than rhetoric; words exist
not with which to define with superclarity the poet&rsquo;s function, source,
and performance.
</p>

<p>
In the true expression of myself I might write Images which
would be worshipped for their perfection by the Imagists. A moment
after, I might gloat and wallow in the joy of my cosmic oneness
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
(anathema to Imagists!) and, perhaps recall Whitman. The
next minute, chronicling some shadowy episode of my variegated
past, I may out-decay the decadent Baudelaire. But, this is always
poetry if, by the magic of its words and the music of its arrangement,
it speaks directly and beautifully to you, giving you that indescribable
but unmistakeable sense of liberation and soul-expansion which
comes on the contemplation of true art.
</p>

<p>
I think I have made myself clear. There is no quarrel with the
Imagists, who have done some beautiful work, as such. But, if they
claim monopoly of inspiration or art, as some of them appear to do,
then&mdash;! Therefore, as a restricted and doctrinaire school, &ldquo;a bas les
Imagistes!&rdquo; But, as an envigored company of the grand army of
poets, &ldquo;Vivent les Imagistes!&rdquo;

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">S</span><span class="postfirstchar">ince</span> even to poets&mdash;and poets are erroneously supposed to
sing their hearts out&mdash;there remains a certain right of privacy, I am
not sure that we do well in writing so much of their personalities and
their individual views of life. When we read a poem, we feel a
temperament behind it; but the effort to catalogue and label that mind
and its &ldquo;message&rdquo; is a little impertinent, and very futile. Mr. Rupert
Brooke is an excellent illustration. His fondness for this or that&mdash;whether
in landscape, food, ideas, or morals&mdash;is hardly our concern.
He deserves to be treated not as a natural-history specimen,&mdash;a peculiar
group of likes and dislikes and convictions,&mdash;but as an artist.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brooke has the distinction, rare for a young poet, of not
having written any bad verse, or of not having printed it. His sole
volume, <em>Poems</em> (Sidgwick and Jackson, London, 1913), manifests
in even its least notable pieces a creative spirit not allowed to run riot,
but chastened and restrained by a keen sense of the obscure laws
whose workings turn passion into a decorative pattern, and the
emotions of the blood into intelligible designs.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
Unless one is deeply concerned with such things, one is not likely
to recognize the fundamental difference between those poets whose
work is merely a more or less interesting emotional cry, and those
nobler and more mature poets in whose work the crude elements of
emotion are subordinated to the exigencies of an artistic conception.
Only the latter have written fine poetry. The former may move
us, as a crying child may move us; but they cannot exalt us to a
peak that rises above the region of mere sympathetic response. They
can never bring us a wind of revelation, or a flame from beyond the
world. They are never the poets to whom other poets&mdash;and these
are the only final judges&mdash;turn for inspiration or for fellowship.
</p>

<p>
For after all, there is no magic in any theme or in the emotion
behind it; what is magical lies wholly in the design, the mould, in
which the poet embodies a feeling that is probably common to all.
No thought is so profound, no intimation so subtle, that it alone suffices
as the stuff of poetry. But any thought, any intimation, if it be
justly correlated and moulded into an organic and expressive shape,
will serve to awaken echoes of a forgotten or unknown loveliness,
and pierce its way into the very soul of the listener.
</p>

<p>
This sense of design of which I speak is not a hard, formal, conscious
thing in the mind of the poet; but rather a carefully trained
instinct, like the instinct that guides the hand of a fine draughtsman
in the drawing of a curve of unexpected beauty. There is a right
place to begin the curve, and a right place to end it; and at every
instant of its length it is swayed and governed by a sense of relation
to preceding and succeeding moments,&mdash;a sense subject to laws that
defy mathematical formulation, but are perilously definite nevertheless.
This sense of control is a rare thing to find in the work of so
young a man as Mr. Brooke. Most young writers seem to approach
their work as an unrestrained expression of themselves,&mdash;which it
should be: but they forget that, for real self-expression, the most
scrupulous mastery of the medium of expression is necessary. They
regard the writing of verse as something in the nature of a joy-ride
with an open throttle,&mdash;instead of seeing in it a piece of difficult driving,
to be achieved only by the use of every subtlety of modulated
speed and controlled steering that the mind is capable of employing.
</p>

<p>
That Mr. Brooke needs no such warning, let the following fine
sonnet bear witness:

<p class="noindent">
It is significant that for his sonnets Mr. Brooke frequently chooses
the Shakesperian form,&mdash;a form which, strangely, English poets have
generally for at least a century discarded in favor of the Petrarchan
model. The common feeling appears to be that the Petrarchan (a-b-b-a,
a-b-b-a, c-d-e-c-d-e or some variation on that scheme) is musical and
emotional; and that the Shakesperian (a-b-a-b, c-d-c-d, e-f-e-f, g-g)
is harsh, cold, mechanical, and incapable of subtle harmonies. The
exact reverse of this is the case. It is perhaps too much to ask the
reader to write a sequence of a hundred sonnets in each form, as a
test; but I am confident that after such an experience, he would
agree with me. The Petrarchan form is capable of only one successful
effect; a rising on the crest of a wave, whose summit is the
end of the eighth line; and a subsidence of the wave, in the course
of the last six lines. The Shakesperian form, on the other hand, is
capable of a literally infinite variety of effects: no pattern is set arbitrarily
in advance, but, as in blank verse, any pattern may be
created. The first twelve lines&mdash;which are nothing but three quatrains&mdash;can
be moulded into a contour that fits any shape or size
of thought whatsoever; and the couplet at the end&mdash;a device despised
by the ignorant&mdash;may be used either to clinch the purport
of the preceding twelve lines, or to blend with them, or startlingly to
refute them, or to serve any other end that the genius of the writer
is capable of imagining. The mere novice will like this form because
of its simple rhyme-scheme and its superficial ease of working;
the experienced amateur will prefer the Petrarchan form because,
while the more complex rhyme-scheme presents for him no difficulties,
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
the basic inadequacies of his thought-structure are fairly well concealed
by the arbitrary sonnet-structure; but the master of imagination
and expression is likely to follow Shakespeare and the novice in
preferring the true English form, wherein he can with perfect freedom
create a subtly modulated movement that will answer to every
sway and leap of his thought. Mr. Brooke, whose sense of form is
keen, is one of those who can safely and wisely try the more interesting
and more dangerous medium.
</p>

<p>
I have thought it worth while to talk a good deal of the sonnet
in connection with Mr. Brooke for the reason that several of his very
finest pieces are in this form. The following is one that stands a
good chance of being in the anthologies a hundred years from now:

Perhaps as magical as any of Mr. Brooke&rsquo;s work is a longer poem
called <em>The Fish</em>,&mdash;a remarkable and original piece of fantasy that
makes the sub-aqueous universe vivid and real to the senses of the
reader, and opens to him a new world of imaginative experience.
Even the opening lines will serve to indicate something of the curious
trance-quality:

In other of these poems, one is struck by Mr. Brooke&rsquo;s passion
for ugliness. He loves to take the most hideous and base facts of
life and give them a place in his work alongside the things of beauty.
It would be hard to find anything more humorous and at the same
time more repulsive than this:

Now, a passion for ugliness like this is really a revolt against
ugliness,&mdash;not the tender-skinned æsthete&rsquo;s revolt, which consists in
denying ugliness and escaping into a remote dream, but the strong
man&rsquo;s, the poet&rsquo;s,&mdash;the revolt that is in effect a seizing of ugliness
in all its repulsiveness and giving it a reason for existence by embodying
it in a chosen pattern that is beautiful. By this method the poet
masters emotion, even unpleasant emotion, making it subservient to
a decorative design dictated by his own sense of proportion. It is
thus that he is able to endure the world of actualities, and to find it
comparable in interest with the world of his own thoughts. And by
this process he saves himself from the sharpest bite of evil. For there
is a curious consolation in transforming a spontaneous cry into a calculated
work of art. By such a process one can give, to elements
that before seemed only parts of a torturing chaos, their ordered
places in a known scheme. One can impose propitious form upon
one&rsquo;s recollections, and create a little world of design-relations where
the poignancy of experience is lost in the discipline of beauty. It is
for this reason that the poet must be considered, in spite of everything,
the happiest of men.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">B</span><span class="postfirstchar">ack</span> to the Old Greek for a starting-point! Two seeds, of the same
species, though distant in space and time, go through an identical
development. Root corresponds with root, stem with stem,
flower with flower, fruit with fruit. Something seems to control all this
change. It is not <b>mere</b> change. It is change with a plan, a purpose, a
pattern. Hence the Greek said that there must be an unchanging
type, a fixed &ldquo;idea,&rdquo; a spiritual, invisible norm, the &ldquo;first&rdquo; and &ldquo;final&rdquo;
cause of all this change, to which all concrete, particular plants of the
species are true. Back of the visible tangible plant must be its <em>Eidos</em>,
its eternal norm, form, idea, &ldquo;species.&rdquo; So with everything. An elaboration
of this conclusion gives the real unchanging, fixed eternal
world back of, underpinning, supporting this visible changing, temporal
world.
</p>

<p>
Such a world-view as this was made more valuable and more imperative
by the break-up of the traditional morals and religion of the
Greek state. The search for the <em>meaning</em> of life was precipitated by
the disintegration of social sanctions and of the guarantees of custom.
This search was voiced in the questionings of Socrates. It was made
serious by the menacing individualism of the sophists. The outcome
was that stability, security, confidence were found in the Platonic doctrine.
Back of this ephemeral world is the real world of &ldquo;ideas,&rdquo; the
unchanging and eternal, upon which we may rest our minds and hearts
amid all this disappointing and desperate flux.
</p>

<p>
Passing by the Middle Ages, which, <em>mutatis mutandis</em>, appropriated
this scheme, we pause over the significance of the Renaissance
period. Two things are uppermost in one&rsquo;s mind and as one thinks of
the tumultuous beginnings of modern life which characterized the
fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries. For one thing, the
Renaissance was the culmination of a long period of absorption in
which men had been gradually working their way back, by intellectual
assimilation, towards the beginnings of the rich tradition which Church
and Empire had stored up. This period of absorption was that five
hundred years during which pagan hordes that had conquered Rome
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
were conquered by the knowledge, faith, custom, civilization of their
victims. From the cultural standpoint the new nations were hungry,
the larder of the old civilization was replete, and hence authority on
one side and absorption on the other became natural and inevitable.
Thus, the philosophical preconceptions, the cosmological ground-principles,
the whole general attitude toward life&rsquo;s problems of the whole
old world were fastened upon the mind of the young European peoples.
<em>It must not be forgotten</em> that all this was <em>aat</em> the <em>hatural</em> achievement
of the new European life and genius, but as foreign to it, as inherited
(and at first as cherished) as grandfatherly ideas are in the mind
of a child. If some day the child must shake off the old conceptions
because he hears the call of life to go forth and achieve his own inner
world, it would be only natural to expect that this young European
giant should some day struggle to cast aside his intellectual inheritance
and go forth to conquer reality for himself, in his own way, with
his own weapons.
</p>

<p>
Well&mdash;and this is the second matter&mdash;it was just that very thing
that was happening in the early &ldquo;teens&rdquo; of our era. The young western
world began to look at life for itself, and a curious, astonished,
wild-eyed look it was. Europe had learned at its mother&rsquo;s knee to
say: &ldquo;The true world is fixed and final. Reality is static.&rdquo; But looking
out now in wonderment, seeing farther than the ancient world had
ever seen, the new world said: &ldquo;Ah, no! The world is not static. The
world <em>moves</em>. Things change.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Two well-known anecdotes are told of Galileo, which, if not
authentic, are well invented. The one tells how, in the dome at Pisa
during worship, the litany or the sermon boring him, he observed the
cathedral chandelier move by the wind and, studying its vibrations,
discovered a basic law of mechanics. The profound meaning of this
anecdote is, obviously, that God spoke to the man more effectively
through the <em>self-moving</em> pendulum than in the rigid, immobile litany
from a rigid, immobile, hieratic heart; and that, if we do not understand
such litany, and it bores us, we may still devoutly worship by
meditating upon what we can understand.
</p>

<p>
The other narrative tells how, imprisoned, tortured inwardly by
a compulsory recantation, Galileo gathered himself together and declared:
&ldquo;<em>E pu se muove</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;it moves though&rdquo;). Galileo never uttered
these words; but the history of the world has uttered them for him!
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
Yes, it moves <em>itself</em>, this earth, and in its motion it knocks everything
down that is in its way. Not the earth alone moves&mdash;all that is in
the world is eternal motion!
</p>

<p>
Man moves&mdash;in space, and time, extensively and intensively.
Truth moves, and, moving, demolishes thrones and altars. Morality
moves, making ancient good uncouth. Faith moves, the human heart
putting into it the pulse beat of its life, and there is no way to stop
this self moving Faith.
</p>

<p>
Those old stories are not true to fact, but they are true to truth.
Galileo <em>did</em> say: &ldquo;It is my opinion that the earth is very noble and
admirable by reason of so many and so different generations and alterations
which are incessantly made therein.&rdquo; And Descartes joined
him: &ldquo;The nature of things physical is much more easily conceived
when they are beheld coming gradually into existence, than when they
are only considered as produced at once in a finished and perfect
state.&rdquo; Thus these men&mdash;and many others&mdash;voiced the changed
temper that was coming over the world,&mdash;the transfer of interest
from the permanent to the changing.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the new attitude was adopted in many departments of
knowledge, but the facts of biology were apparently all against its
becoming a general philosophical movement. The species of plants
and animals had every appearance of being fixed and final, unchangeably
stamped once for all upon the sentient world by the Creator. Not
only so, but the wonderful adaptation of organism to environment,
of organ to organism, a marvelous and delicate complexity of teleological
adjustment, seemed to testify unanswerably to the reality of
fixed and final types, to a static underpinning for all this changing
order.
</p>

<p>
<em>Origin of</em> Species! That was the bomb with which Charles Darwin
destroyed the last stronghold of a static world-view. &ldquo;Species&rdquo;
is the scholastics&rsquo; translation of the Greek <em>Eidos</em>, the fixed and final
type or idea which is first and final cause of the changing life of each
creature. Species is a synonym and epitome of fixity and finality;
it is the key-word of a static other-world reality. When Darwin said,
&ldquo;<em>Origin</em> of Species,&rdquo; he was cramming the conflict of the ancient wisdom
and the modern knowledge into a bursting phrase. When he
said of species what Galileo said of the earth, <em>e pu se muove</em>, he
emancipated once for all genetic and experimental ideas as an <em>organon</em>
<a id="page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a>
of asking questions and looking for explanations. He lifted
the biological gates which had kept back the flood of change from
inundating the old fields of fixity.
</p>

<p>
In sum: The world of thought is slowly, painfully making a
change in its fundamental attitude toward reality such as is not made
oftener than once in several millennia: One general conception of
reality was all-controlling for 2,000 years. Then from Copernicus
to Darwin many factors in a world-subversive change were struggling
for recognition. Conceptions that had reigned in the philosophy of
nature and of knowledge for 2,000 years rested in the superiority of
the fixed and final: they rested on treating change and origin as signs
of defect and unreality. In laying hands upon the sacred ark of absolute
permanency; in treating forms that had been regarded as types
of fixity and perfection as originating and passing away, the &ldquo;origin of
species&rdquo; introduced a mode of thinking that in the end was bound to
transform the logic of knowledge, and hence the treatment of all our
values and verities and virtues.
</p>

<p>
But heaven and earth and species are not all. Shall there be no
Copernicus of the moral heavens, no Galileo of the moral earth, no
Darwin of the moral life?
</p>

<p>
Hove now Friedrich Nietzsche into sight!
</p>

<p>
Loyalty has ever been the basic virtue, foundation of life and of
law. Naturally, in the moral world, the objects to which loyalty shall
be related will be objects that are real. But, as we have seen, in the
old world, the real was the unchangeable, the immobile, the finished,
the final, the absolute. To these, therefore, the old loyalty was directed
and dedicated.
</p>

<p>
Comes now Friedrich Nietzsche, a man in whose name the entire
moral revolution of our time has found its most pregnant expression,
and declares war upon that old loyalty, and does so in the name of
a new culture, a new humanity. To him this loyalty is not only an
empty folly; it is more than that&mdash;a crime against life, a weakening
of human power. To him, not stationariness, but <em>self-changing</em>, is
the life task of man. He feels himself akin only to him who changes.
Every moment of life has an existence, a right, a content of its own.
No present point of time has a right to lay claim, on its own account,
to the next point. From what we now will, think, feel, no man may
presume to require us to will, think, feel the same way tomorrow.
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
And this preaching of Nietzsche&rsquo;s on the duty of change as against
the old duty to change never has found more ears to listen and more
hearts to believe than any other preaching of our time. This new
preaching is at once most influential and most dangerous. But its
very dangerousness is a most wholesome and necessary part of the
modern moral view of life.
</p>

<p>
Is loyalty, then, something about which there is nothing to be
learned? Is there no counterfeit and caricature of loyalty? No mask
behind which men hide their indolence and complacency and thoughtlessness?
You meet a man whom you have not seen in long years,
and you say to him: &ldquo;Why, you have not changed a bit, you are
precisely the same as in the old days.&rdquo; Have you praised him, necessarily?
If he left you as a child, looking and speaking and thinking
and acting like a child, ought he not to have changed? Does a fruit
remain what it was as bud and blossom? Life is development&mdash;but
development is a constant <em>self-changing</em>. Development is an incessant
<em>dis</em>-loyalty to what is already there. And if man, just because
he is man, and has a will of his own and can set himself against the
law of development, should sell his life to the force of inertia&mdash;would
not that be a crime against life? And yet, even such a deed men
call loyalty! Men say that they want to be faithful to the heritage
of the fathers. Which is often enough simply to say that they mean
to store away their heritage where it will be kept from the world&rsquo;s
light and air that would destroy it&mdash;but where, also, it can enter into
no human intercourse, serve no life, fulfil no end of life. This loyalty
of unchangeableness to the heritage puts the talent in a napkin,
and there can be no increase. Men say that they mean to abide faithful
to their faith unto death. Often enough this is only stubbornness
and narrowness. It requires no art and no merit to exercise such
faithfulness. All one needs to do is to close one&rsquo;s eyes and ears to
what lies beyond the bounds of this faith, to forego the questionings
and uncertainties that others must pass through,&mdash;and then to send in
one&rsquo;s claim to the reward and gratitude due such loyalty! Today it is
quite the thing at college commencements to spy out the men who are
models of such loyalty and to say: &ldquo;Look how firm and steadfast
and rock-like they are!&rdquo; But it cannot be denied that much of this
illustrious loyalty is nothing but natural or voluntary incapacity to
think more widely than others have taught them to think, or, for the
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
matter of that, permitted them to think. Back of this bragging about
principles which are vainly declared to be unshakable, there is frequently
nothing but an ill-natured obstinacy whose so-called principles
have no other basis than the self-interest to which they are contributary.
It was this loyalty to the finished,&mdash;finished cult, finished
belief, finished customs and practices, finished religion and morality,&mdash;that
stoned the prophets and crucified Jesus. It was this kind of loyalty
that the mediaeval church imposed upon the &ldquo;Faithful,&rdquo; imprisoning
the conscience therein for time and for eternity. Bound by an
oath of loyalty, the priest renounced the world; the monk and nun
under monastic vows dedicated their lives to the church, their services
to &ldquo;heaven.&rdquo; And hence it marked an epoch when Luther called
their loyalty a sin, and went forth into the world, the home, the vocation,
the business, breaking the vows of priest and cloister. Was
such disloyalty to a sacred obligation loyalty in the sixteenth century,
and shall it be blasphemy in the twentieth? Is it not rather a
blasphemy to preach to men a loyalty which obligates them to forego
the use of their best and noblest powers, which condemns them to
spiritual standstill in the eternal progressive movement of life?
</p>

<p>
Take some illustrations which will test insight and courage.
There is the constitution of the United States. Shall we assume
toward it the loyalty of fixedness and finality, or the loyalty of change?
No man of veneration and equipoise would favor capricious or precipitate
or superfluous change in so noble a document. But, for all
that, the experience of life made the constitution for life&rsquo;s sake, and
the maker is more than the made. If our national life pass&mdash;as pass
it has&mdash;into new seas and under new stars, where life needs a change
of the constitution, then the principle which prompted the people to
frame the constitution in the first place requires them to change it
to meet the new needs of our growing and changing national life.
The superficial loyalty to the changeless letter must yield to the profound
loyalty to the ever-changing spirit. The constitution is for
the sake of the people, not the people for the sake of the constitution.
They, rather than it, are sacred.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, there is the modern problem of marriage, the family,
and the home. Shall ours be the old loyalty that holds the customs
of the past inviolable, marriage indissoluble, the inherited patterns of
home and family unchangeable&mdash;the loyalty of fixedness and finishedness;
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
or shall it be the loyalty of change in all these matters to meet
the changing needs and situations of our burdened and bewildered
modernity? Again, no man of sanctity and sanity and stability of
soul can favor any arbitrary radicalism that is subversive of time-honored
institutions <em>for no better reason</em> than a fleeting fancy, or the
passing of the romance of the honeymoon, or raw self-will, or an unanticipated
burden or hardship. But, for all that, the marriage institution,
like all others, is for the sake of man and not man for the sake
of the institution. It was <em>life</em> that originated our domestic ideas and
customs and conventions and codes; and if ever life, in the interest
of its well-being and progress, requires changes suited to new needs
and new days, then the &ldquo;new loyalty&rdquo; to life that ever changes must
replace the old loyalty to codes that never change. Codes, too, are
for the sake of life, not life for the sake of codes. No loyalty to the
letter that means disloyalty to the spirit.
</p>

<p>
And there is the everlasting problem of education. Education
in the past had for its subject matter symbols&mdash;reading, writing, arithmetic,
grammar, rhetoric, logic, and the like. The new education has
for its subject matter realities&mdash;nature and history. The old education
taught topics or subjects; the new education teaches boys and
girls. According to the old education, knowledge precedes action;
according to the new education, action precedes knowledge. In the
old education things were done to the pupils; in the new education the
pupils do things.
</p>

<p>
The old school teacher was a &ldquo;star and dwelt apart&rdquo;&mdash;that is,
his aloofness and superiority were indispensable. He taught from
above. The new school teacher is down among the students, a democrat
of democrats. The old school teacher communicated knowledge
from without; the new school teacher develops interest from within.
The old education was atomistic, the new organic. The old education
was a donation to the pupils, the new is an achievement by them.
The old education proceeded on the assumption that man is primarily
intellect; the new that he is primarily will. The old education preceded
life and fitted for it; the new education is a part of life itself.
</p>

<p>
It is a great change. According to the old theory, there was perfection
to start with, perfection at the top. All that we needed was
to pipe it down through aqueducts so well constructed that nothing
that was in could get out, nothing that was without could get in;
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
and thus&mdash;thus only&mdash;would the vain and empty world and life be
filled with value and verity and virtue&mdash;donation on the one side, reception
on the other.
</p>

<p>
But the time came when men asked: if there is perfection to
start with, why start? Why paint the lily? And if there is perfection
to start with, how does there come to be imperfection? How
can imperfection come from perfection? Ugly questions, these! Soon
the world was turned upside down.
</p>

<p>
The new theory holds that matters began very humbly and
struggled and fought their way slowly upward. Ascent from below,
not descent from above. No values or verities or virtues donated,
all achieved. Education an evolution, not a communication.
</p>

<p>
Some business men favor the old education. Their world is one
of mechanism and authority. They think that they do not need men
with initiative, spontaneity, freedom. That is their prerogative, as
it was of the king of old. They need the mechanical, the automatic,
the impersonal in man. This fits into their world. This is what the
old education stands for. The new education unfolds and matures
personalities. Personalities make good masters but poor servants.
</p>

<p>
Business men as a class are perhaps our best men. But the very
conditions of business economy and certainty are the impersonal, the
unfree, the mechanical. So business has warped the judgment of some
good men and led them astray on the most fundamental problem in
the history of the race.
</p>

<p>
Were it not multiplying illustrations, the same point might be
urged as to politics. Does not party loyalty often mean personal
servility? As a matter of fact what is loyalty in one situation, or
one age, may be simple cowardice or abjectness in another.
</p>

<p>
The upshot is that the modern man has to endure the reproach
of not thinking and feeling and judging and acting as men formerly
did&mdash;the reproach of perfidy toward the past, its solutions and its sanctities.
In consequence, it would not be a bad idea for him to cultivate
respect for the past, gratitude for its achievements, appreciation for
its unfinished tasks. Still, he should learn to accept the reproach as
praise,&mdash;recognition that, though problems remain the same, solutions
change; though sanctity abide, the objects which are sacred
change. <em>Evolutionism no longer recognizes any fact as sacred.</em>
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
Man is inwardly working on ever farther, ever overcoming the old
and conquering ever the new&mdash;this must also be recognized.
</p>

<p>
It is said that we ought to love the old, the finished. But is love
blind? Does it consist in advocating the point of view of one&rsquo;s friend,
not because it seems true, but just because love requires it? Is loyalty
of love the faculty of adaptation with which we remodel ourselves
after the image of another? Is one disloyal in love if one affirm
one&rsquo;s self against another, or if another affirm himself against one?
Surely fidelity of friendship, even of marriage, ought not to be the
grave of one&rsquo;s own being. Surely loyalty should be the life and not
the death of one&rsquo;s self! Surely we must all see with our own eyes,
hear with our own ears, judge with our own judgments, love with
our own hearts, for the quite plain reason that we have no others
with which we can do these things.
</p>

<p>
And so, if we take up this great subject in a large way, as
Nietzsche has done, we see that we have all broken with the old loyalty,
and that the consummation of this breach has been life and
blessing to us. We moderns all somehow live in a disloyalty which
we have committed&mdash;imputed to us as transgression, viewed by us as
our strength and pride. We have all become unfaithful,&mdash;as children
to our parents, as pupils to our teachers, as disciples to our masters.
We felt ourselves bound to them; we loosed ourselves from
them. The paths they walked we have forsaken. In the strange untrodden
land whither our vagrant feet have wandered, we &ldquo;came to
ourselves&rdquo; in declaring disobedience to the laws of tradition, in breaking
loyalty to the rules of the schools. It is precisely on this account
that once again we have won spiritual life, a living art and science,
a living religion and morality. We have snapped the fetters fastened
upon us in the name of the old loyalty, and all that is great and fruitful
and constructive in the life of the modern spirit is a monument
of the disloyalty which its creators have built thereto. Nothing is
gained any longer by our screening ourselves behind this word loyalty,
and making believe that we shall not be found out! We owe it to
ourselves and we owe it to the world to confess frankly that we have
done with the old loyalty to the unchangeable and the finished, for
that is to be loyal to an unreality, <em>since there is no such thing</em>. Even
God, if he be the living God, cannot be the same yesterday, today,
and forever. But we owe it even more to ourselves and to the world
to strive for a clear position in reference to this question which is so
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
profoundly agitating our entire moral world today. We may not
abandon the field to those who would demolish the temple of the old
goddess simply that they may celebrate upon its ruins the orgies of
their caprice and inconstancy and characterlessness. If ever there was
a doctrine whose right is easily turned into a wrong, whose truth
into an error, whose blessing into a curse, it is this Nietzschean doctrine
of the right and the duty of ceaseless change, of self-dependence,
by which we are redeemed from slavery to the past. If the old loyalty&mdash;loyalty
to the past&mdash;no longer holds men, wherewith shall they be
held? Shall they be like the weathervane blown hither and thither
by every wind of doctrine, or like the rudderless ship driven aimless
and planless over the high seas by the midnight hurricane? Better
a thousand times be tethered to the old loyalty than to be doomed to
such a life of levity and poiselessness and flightiness.
</p>

<p>
But the new loyalty which we seek, without which we go forward
into no future, should it not be more stable and enduring and
<b>loyal</b> than the old? If a moment releases itself from what to it is past,
and validates its right as a self-dependent life to its predecessor, a
birth has transpired in man, and birth means pain. Without such
pain, man has changed his situation, but not himself. A new color
has come upon the motly manifoldness of his life&mdash;<em>he</em> has remained
the same. Trees do not have their roots in the air. Weaklings cannot
make the real change&mdash;it needs a strength that they do not have.
The strength to change really&mdash;only he has this who bears the new
loyalty in his own bosom; loyalty not to his opinion, not to his learning
and heritage, but loyalty to his <em>growth</em>, to the great eternal goal
of life, to the great sacred task which he has yet to fulfil in life.
</p>

<p>
Loyal to ourself? Would that it might be so! But the self that
we would at first be loyal to is not <b>our</b> self at all. It is foreign wares,
loaded upon us,&mdash;first even in the nursery, slyly slipped subsequently
upon our shoulders,&mdash;foreign words, foreign worths! Loyalty to what
satiates, not the better loyalty to our hunger! We begin to live only
when we live in our hunger; our hunger is we ourselves. It is a good
satiety only if a new hunger comes from it. Loyalty to our self&mdash;this
is to keep <b>our</b> life alive in us&mdash;a young glad life, that never grows
old, because the old is ever transmuted into a new. This loyalty to
ourself,&mdash;it is to expel from every truth its error, from every boundary
<a id="page-66" class="pagenum" title="66"></a>
its limit which blocks the vision into the wide world, the blue
sky, and the distant sea.
</p>

<p>
Loyalty to men? Would that it might be so! But such loyalty
costs so much trouble and toil. For the faithfulness that is genuine
and living, there is no law, no binding <em>I must</em>, only a glorious <em>I will</em>.
One day we shall have done with the loyalty which means master and
servant, leader and led&mdash;the loyalty of the dog that is loyalest to him
who feeds him best or beats him hardest. One day we shall understand
what the loyalty of man means&mdash;this new loyalty toward man,
in which souls meet and chime and work together, and live in each
other, yet each remains itself and true to itself.
</p>

<p>
So, then, the law of change and of growth is the law of the new
loyalty, as the law of fixedness and finishedness and finality was of
the old. It is the duty of such new loyalty to protect itself against
the deadening force of habit and of petrifaction, to guard itself against
any obedience by which it would become disloyal to itself. Such
loyalty is too honorable to humor inertia and laziness under its banner,
too courageous to conceal cowardice behind a slave&rsquo;s patience.
</p>

<p>
But thought on our theme is usually lifted up to where the sky
keeps company with the granite and the grass, to a religious elevation.
Nor do we need stop short here. Ultimately the new loyalty
is loyalty to God, the new God, of whom something must be said
later. The God in whom all fulness dwells summons us to ever new
truths, and reveals underground wells of living water throwing its
spray aloft on life&rsquo;s ferns and flowers. To be loyal to him is never
to sunder ourselves from his fulness and freshness, but to co-work
with him who is forever making all things new.
</p>

<p>
And now I think we are at the end. The result? It is needless
to state it, but I would not shrink from the thankless task. In a word,
then, the new loyalty&mdash;in harmony with the whole great changed
view of the world and of life&mdash;is loyalty to change and becoming
rather than to finishedness and finality; to the future rather than to
the past; to ideals rather than to conventions; to freedom rather than
to authority; to personality rather than to institution; to character
rather than to respectability; to our hunger rather than to our satiety;
to the God that is to be rather than to the God that is. Thus the
loyalty abides, but the objects of loyalty change and pass.

MARGARET C. ANDERSON
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">n</span> one of Chicago&rsquo;s big department stores of the cheaper type you
may&mdash;provided you&rsquo;re something of a poet&mdash;walk straight into the
heart of a musical adventure. It is that amazing, resentful, and very
satisfying adventure of discovering genius at work, under the by no
means unique condition of being unrecognized.
</p>

<p>
You go to one of the upper floors where the big lunch-room is.
You find a table near a platform in the center, on which sit four
musicians&mdash;a pianist, a &rsquo;cellist, a clarinet<em>ist</em> (if there is such a thing),
and a second violinist. You expect the usual clamor....
</p>

<p>
Suddenly you notice a fifth figure who has been sitting quietly in
the background. She comes forward with a violin in her hand, and
stands ready to play. There is something still about her&mdash;that quality
of stillness which is invariably the first thing you notice in any dynamic.
She seems not scornful of her surroundings, but quite indifferent to
them; not arrogant, but sure of power; not timid, and yet incredibly
soft and shy and serious. She is plainly foreign; she is German, looks
French, and plays like a Viennese. Or, to be exact, she merges the
German &ldquo;heaviness&rdquo; with the Viennese gay-sadness, and the result is a
sensuousness that is both deep and clear, with the haunting wail that
distinguishes all the music which comes from Vienna. She looks
almost like a little girl; but you would notice her any place because
of that stillness and the haunting appeal that always attaches to a
certain type of eyes and mouth&mdash;the kind which seem to say: &ldquo;I
will make music for you; I will take you to a new world. I will do
it because I can dream intensely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She begins to play, and you understand why you watched her.
The depth of it startles you at first&mdash;it is so big, so moving, so almost
uncanny coming from such a small person, whose hands seem
scarcely large enough to hold a violin. It is playing of the Mischa
Elman type, without his emotional extravagances and with something
that is more soul-shaking. If I were an Imagist I could find the
right word; but this music eludes me. It is sure and simple. It grips
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
you till you don&rsquo;t know whether you are listening to music or to the
urge of some hidden inner self. It is a divine thing.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of it the waitresses rush back and forth, the patrons
eat their food with interest, only pausing to applaud when some tawdry
vaudevillian sings a particularly vulgar song. The dishes clang,
some one upsets a tray with a great crash, and at intervals there is a
tango outrage by a couple who know nothing about dancing. Underneath
it all the violin throbs its deep accompaniment.
</p>

<p>
I wish I could make a poem of it. I have thought of taking my
poet friends there and having the thing done. But almost without
exception the poets I know don&rsquo;t care for music essentially; though
why a mind keyed to the tone qualities of words should be so tone-deaf
in another medium has always been a mystery to me. And what
a poet&rsquo;s opportunity here: &ldquo;the boom and squeal,&rdquo; and out of it music
that is as sacred as an organ meditation and as passionate as a Russian
slave song!
</p>

<p>
However, generalizations will not serve to give any musician&rsquo;s
special quality, and this one is so emphatically individual
as to make description easy. To begin with, she was concertising in
Europe as a wonder-child at the age of six. For a number of years her
playing brought forth a chorus of superlatives from the critics: &ldquo;her
full blooming tone, her great taste in phrasing, economic use of the
bow, glowing passion of interpretation; her fiery temperament, remarkable
earnestness and will power, the soul, life, and emotion in
her presentations.&rdquo; The verdict of a &ldquo;a veritable artist soul&rdquo; appeared
to be unanimous; and one man summed up with admirable insight and
simplicity: &ldquo;Her chief excellence is in this: that she seeks her main
task to be an artist in the real and earnest sense of the word, and whosoever
comes to hear music does not go empty from her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Friedrich Spielhagen wrote a sonnet to her, of which I have a
careful, but metrically inadequate, translation:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Thou standst before us, a picture of wondrous charm;</p>
      <p class="verse">The little violin thou holdst, in tenderess,</p>
      <p class="verse">Half maidenly, half like a child in dress</p>
      <p class="verse">Hast soared away from Heaven&rsquo;s angel-farm</p>
      <p class="verse">Toward where thy large mild eye is dreaming.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
And he ended it with these lines:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
<a id="page-36" class="pagenum" title="36"></a>
      <p class="verse">Thou movest thy bow;</p>
      <p class="verse">No sounds are these of nicely movéd strings,</p>
      <p class="verse">No, No! Thy own sweet soul rings out and sings</p>
      <p class="verse">The melodies that have with you come</p>
      <p class="verse">From yon high wide-sphered home,</p>
      <p class="verse">To where thy longing soul swings upward now.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
Our apologies to Mr. Spielhagen for that more than atrocious
twelfth line and for the other deficiencies! But the last line is particularly
keen in its photography. It has the spirit of her.
</p>

<p>
After much touring in Europe she came to this country and
played under the same promising conditions. The critics predicted
that if she should decide to stay here she would probably out-rival our
own few noted women violinists. And then came a period of sorrow,
bereavement, hardship, and illness&mdash;and in the meantime the problem
of living. That problem becomes a real one when an artist loves life
just a bit more than her art and refuses to make that spiritual compromise
which life tries to wrest from one in the hard places. One
must live, and it takes money to do it rather than art. The romantic notion
that all genius has to do is to stand up and make itself heard is
one of the silliest notions the great public suffers from. Only the
hundredth person recognizes genius when it proclaims itself; the rest
are as blind as this department-store audience until the sign-posts have
been put up, with letters large enough to be easily read. Also, the
amount of machinery and money involved in the arrangement of concert
engagements would surprise the public as much as the true stories
of what it costs the &ldquo;wealthy patron&rdquo; to get his artist started toward
recognition.
</p>

<p>
And so this particular genius will continue for a while to cast her
pearls in a lunch-room, and a few of the discerning will find her out
and thank their stars that they may hear such beauty at the small cost
of a bad club sandwich and a worse cup of coffee.
</p>

<p>
If you go there you will be haunted by music for days afterward.
I say &ldquo;haunted&rdquo; because that is the only word to describe your feeling
of pursuit by melody. And I think I have discovered the reason
for it. A poet once said that the only permanent emotion we human
beings are capable of is&mdash;not love, as we like to imagine&mdash;but <em>longing</em>.
And that is what this music says to you. It is the very essence of longing&mdash;the
eternal seeking, the rapturous satisfaction, the disappointment,
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
and the renewed quest. I have never heard such a quality of
<em>sehnsucht</em> in any music; it is almost more than you can bear. Of
course, in these surroundings, you must listen to the complete gamut
of new popular songs; but at intervals, when the managerial demand
for &ldquo;noise&rdquo; can be ignored for a moment, you will be rewarded by
the Thais <em>Meditation</em> or a Schutt waltz or that exquisite Saint-Saens
poem called <em>The Swan</em>&mdash;or even a Tschaikowsky song. Where does
the tone come from, you keep wondering? Not from a wooden instrument,
not from small human fingers, surely. It is tone of such
richness and depth that you sometimes have the illusion of each note
being sung twice. &ldquo;It transcends music to me entirely and becomes
a matter of life&mdash;or of soul,&rdquo; said a critic who listened with me the
other day.
</p>

<p>
Through it all the artist&rsquo;s earnest face is still and unchanging.
That is part of the fascination&mdash;the contrast of that tumultuous singing
and the thoughtful, dreaming face that seems to control it all. &ldquo;My
violin belongs to me&mdash;yes,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;but that is such a cold word.
It is part of my body. I feel it is growing on me just like my arms
and hands. I could not live without it.&rdquo; If you watch her closely you
will decide that her playing is the result of an extraordinary sensitiveness
to life. If you know her, as I do, you will expand that judgment
to this one: an extraordinary strength about life; for she is both deep
and strong&mdash;qualities that are supposed to be inseparable, but which
are so rarely found together that their combination means&mdash;a great
spirit.

<span class="firstchar">C</span><span class="postfirstchar">harles</span> Ashleigh, who makes his appearance in this issue, was born in
London twenty-five years ago. He was educated in England, Switzerland, and
Germany, and speaks French, German, and Spanish, &ldquo;as well as two or three
varieties of English and American slang.&rdquo; He has wandered in Europe, South
America and this country, traveling on foot through Argentine, Chile, and Peru,
and in the States as a hobo. He has been sailor, newspaper man, tramp, actor,
farm hand, railroad clerk, interpreter, and a few other things. He has written
verse, short stories, social studies, literary criticism, and lectured on his travels
as well as on sociological, literary, and dramatic subjects. Quite unlike those poets
who insist that they have no opinions on any subject&mdash;that they simply photograph
life&mdash;Mr. Ashleigh states his creed in this way: &ldquo;I am interested in
Labor, literature, and many other aspects and angles of Life. Men and deeds are
to me of primary importance and books secondary.&rdquo; We look for big things

GEORGE BRANDES&mdash;A HASTY IMPRESSION
</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> man who fought the big battle for Ibsen and Nietzsche should
have filled Madison Square Garden; as it was, the little Comedy
Theatre wasn&rsquo;t large enough to hold the audience, although Scandinavian
patriotism accounted for a good deal of it. He came on the
stage with Brander Matthews, the apotheosis of the academic, and the
contrast was striking. Matthews was tall, dull, professional. Brandes,
with his keen face, alert eyes, and shock of grayish hair, was possibly
the most fully alive person in the room. He radiated interest&mdash;human
connection with anything vital.
</p>

<p>
We were all a little sorry his subject was Shakespeare; we wanted
to hear of something modern. And when the first part of the lecture
was read, couched in scholarly but terse English, we felt cheated. It
was good criticism, and informing, but it wasn&rsquo;t the sort of thing we
had expected from Brandes. Suddenly a spark shot out. (The quotation
is from memory):
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
We cannot emphasize too strongly the fact that all works of literature
which have a real effect on mankind, all works which endure hundreds of
years, find their inspiration not in books, but in life.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
The words were pronounced with excited intensity. Soon came
another:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
We used to define the genius as the man who interprets his age; now
we know that the genius is the man who, working against his age, creates new
times.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Dr. Brandes broke into a lively sally at the Baconians. He spoke
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s errors in scholarship. These Bacon would surely
have avoided, but of Shakespeare&rsquo;s great lines Bacon could not possibly
have written one. He ended that section with something like this:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
The Baconian theory was founded by the uneducated, it was developed
by the half-educated, and it is now held solely by idiots.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
The audience was immensely pleased at his sharp fire.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Brandes&rsquo; epigrams sometimes sound as if he substituted wit
for wisdom. But that is because the epigrams stick and are repeated.
His method is to open with an epigram to catch the attention, to proceed
with a line of sound argument, and at the end to finish superbly
<a id="page-41" class="pagenum" title="41"></a>
with a sentence that contains his conclusions and impales his opponent
at the same time.
</p>

<p>
With Frank Harris, Dr. Brandes was no more gentle. By parallel
quotation Harris was made to appear ridiculous. Brandes showed
that whatever in his writings is sound has been said before. This was
the end of the lecture:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
Mr. Harris says that it is possible to admire Shakespeare, but that it
is impossible to worship him. Ladies and gentlemen, I do the impossible.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Afterwards came a supper of the Scandinavian Society, at which
the guest of honor made a speech that looked brilliant and was lively
even as a piece of pantomime&mdash;but it was in Danish. Dr. Brandes was
beaming and unaffectedly cordial with everybody. He smilingly interrupted
one of the pompous addresses in his honor to correct a quotation
from Goethe. He proposed a toast to the charming young lady
who acted as his American manager, and said that the success of his
tour was due entirely to her. Later a consul made a highly complimentary,
but exceedingly tedious, speech. Dr. Brandes fidgeted until
he could stand it no longer, then he quickly got up, took his champagne
glass, ran over to the orator and slapped him on the shoulder,
saying, &ldquo;You are a very nice man.&rdquo; The rest was drowned in the toast.
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="A_NEW_LITERATURE">
A NEW LITERATURE
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
The other day an illustrator saw a hand-mirror in a publisher&rsquo;s
office. He put the mirror against a book cover and held it at arm&rsquo;s
length. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the ideal jacket for a novel. Every
woman likes to imagine herself the heroine of the book she is reading.&rdquo;
But the publisher was wiser. &ldquo;You are half right,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But
she wants to be a Gibson heroine. To see her own face, without flattery,
would startle her into disapproval of the book.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A recent symposium in <em>The Sun</em> bore the impressive title, <em>The
Sentimentalization of Woman in American Fiction</em>. All the authors
were agreed that realism doesn&rsquo;t go because of the desire of the reader
to be flattered. If she isn&rsquo;t, the novel is &ldquo;unpleasant,&rdquo; &ldquo;depressing.&rdquo;
You may paint your villainess black, but, as your reader will take her
for an enemy, you must see that she is properly punished. But if your
heroine does anything unconventional, it must be of the kind that your
reader enjoys by imagination, though she wouldn&rsquo;t have the courage
<a id="page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
to do it. Only you must not make the thrills so strong as to shock the
reader into self-consciousness and self-disapproval. Georg Brandes
said that our novels are written by old maids for old maids. If we
would only put into our literature the same genius and daring that we
put into our skyscrapers!
</p>

<p>
The thing none of the authors seemed to see is that it is futile to
stop at blaming the readers. Of course the great public is comparatively
stupid. It is everywhere, it always has been and always will be.
What is a leader if he is not someone in advance of the others? And the
essential act for a leader is to lead. He can&rsquo;t get a following until he
does that. Only a coward stays behind and flatters the crowd because
he is afraid they will not come after him. Perhaps they won&rsquo;t follow
his particular route. But if he goes on fearlessly he has done the best
that is in him, anyway. The chances are that if he has a sincere conviction
and marches far enough in one direction they will at least
struggle along after a while. They may even follow in hordes. What
we need first is not a more intelligent public, but courageous writers.
</p>

<p>
Naturally the matter is not simple. Your artist has to be fed and
clothed. If he is creating a new medium&mdash;as did Wagner&mdash;he even
needs large resources to produce his art. The solution used to be the
wealthy patron. The petty monarch maintained a musician or a
painter to enhance the glory of his court. The noble supported a
writer from personal pride. The monastery afforded a refuge for the
unworldly creator. It would be difficult to find a great artist before the
last century who did not have some such subsidy, unless he had means
of his own.
</p>

<p>
Since then democracy has permeated the world. Fast presses,
advertising, and royalties have been invented. Now the public is
the writer&rsquo;s patron. Music is often subsidized, to be sure, and painters
can still sell their canvases to the wealthy. But the earnings of the
writer are in strict proportion to the number of copies of his books that
can be sold.
</p>

<p>
There is a distinct advantage in this situation. The virtue of
democracy is not the government of the majority, but the opportunity
of the minority. The minority becomes, not a defensive close corporation,
but a body of fighting visionaries. The emphasis is placed on
growth. The eternal impulse of the minority to turn itself into a
majority prevents a static age. The strongest lead, instead of the
highly born.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
So it must be with our writers. Difficulty insures heroes. We can
discount at once the truckling commercial writers. But the others must
be deeply sincere and strong in order to exist at all. There is little
room for the dilletante. Let our young people who have something
to say recognize the situation. They must dedicate themselves to a
probable poverty. They must gird their loins and sharpen their
weapons. They must be prepared to wait years, if need be, even for
recognition. Every energy must be devoted to saying as well as may
be the thing that is in them. And so, hoping nothing, fearing nothing,
living simply, supporting themselves as best they may, but always
doing the thing that is worth while for its own sake, they may produce
a literature that has not been equalled since the world began.
</p>

<p>
Others of us can share in this glorious undertaking. Discerning
critics must sift the true from the false. They must lay aside the twin
snobberies of praising or blaming a work because of its popularity.
They must fight eternally for the sincere. They must point out directions,
they must prize meanings above methods. They must give a
nucleus to the intelligent reading public and constantly augment it.
They must bear sturdy witness to the fact that art is not an amusement
for idle moments, but the consciousness of the race. They must show
its relation to life as well as to living. They must be predisposed in
favor of no work on account of its nationality, school or tendency.
Just as Brandes enlarged the conception of literature by showing it
as a world phenomenon, they must rid it of petty divisions in the realm
of thought. No more should such a statement as &ldquo;Galsworthy is a
poet rather than a novelist&rdquo; be allowed to pass as criticism. A novelist
may be a poet or a philosopher or a psychologist or a historian or a
sociologist. Any of these may combine the intrinsic abilities of any or
all of the others. He is greater for doing so. The only test of his work
is its effectiveness. A work of art is an organism, the highest product
of nature, infinitely more real, more beautiful, more potent, than any
flower. Only when we see it as such, and not as a collection of petals
and stamens, or as a member of a species, shall we know it.
</p>

<p>
The whole problem of creating a literature, as of doing anything
else, is one of direction and power. If we blame someone else for our
deficiencies, if we stand aloof, if we bow to circumstances and are
afraid to pay for what we want, we shall of course do nothing. And
we shall not enjoy ourselves or the world much either. But if we fix
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
on a goal that is worth a life, and set out for it with the joyous spirit
of adventurers, risking everything, enduring everything, sleeping under
the stars, staying hard and keen, we shall command the fates. What
more could we ask of the world?

<em>The Idiot</em>, <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>, <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, etc.,

York.]
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
It&rsquo;s not a matter of intellect or logic, it&rsquo;s loving (life) with one&rsquo;s inside,
with one&rsquo;s stomach....

<p class="noindent">
Chiefly concerned with the fester of civilization, literature, music,
painting, all the modern forms of individual expression are elliptical
in the sense that the old æsthetic values of emotional beauty seem to
have become nullified, or else congealed, in the artist&rsquo;s direct application
of his instrument to the repudiation of fixed social values or moralities;
to the expansion of life-interests. We today want more than
beauty of external form; we want the beauty of depth!
</p>

<p>
The true artist is such primarily because of his engrossing appetite
for life, because (as Flaubert said) of the chaos in his soul. And
although Flaubert kept on chiseling words around the lives of men
and women totally devoid of inspirating individuality, his dictum has
been nobly exemplified in the life and writings of Fyodor Dostoevsky,
that great-hearted epileptic Russian of whose psychological powers
Nietzsche admittedly availed himself.
</p>

<p>
Tolstoy was reported to have said, in conversation with a writer
for <em>Le Temps</em>, &ldquo;A woman who has never suffered pain is a beast.&rdquo;
He could have stretched the allegation to include the other sex, if only
by way of illusion to that intense spiritual quality in modern Russian
literature&mdash;a literature that has never been (notably) an off-shoot of,
as much as a protest against, the retrogressive structures of its respective
periods.
</p>

<p>
This spiritual, or psychical, concern with the individual&rsquo;s adjustment
to the functioning of life has been revealed to highest degree in
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
Dostoevsky&rsquo;s novels. It is also manifest in the analytical mould assumed
by the creative arts of our time.
</p>

<p>
While Dostoevsky&rsquo;s personality is separably bound up with his
work, profitable appreciation of the latter can be considerably amplified
with knowledge of the important facts of his life and the conditions
with which he struggled. I will record the more essential facts
of his life as I have gathered them, and try to explain the causes that
have made for the distinction in his work from that of all other writers.
</p>

<p>
He was born in a charity-hospital in Moscow, in 1821. His father
was an army-surgeon, his mother a store-keeper&rsquo;s daughter. I like to
think that he derived his expressive powers, or rather the nebulæ out
of which they subsequently developed, from his mother, perhaps partly
because of my theory that men of acute genius ultimately do transcend
the difference of sex in the quality of their personalities as well as in
that of their work.
</p>

<p>
Like most imaginative youths who come into contact with fine
art, Dostoevsky was stimulated to literary expression by his study of
classical and contemporaneous European literature. He had lived
twenty-three years when he graduated from a St. Petersburg school of
military engineering. His first novel, <em>Poor Folk</em>, was published three
years later, and served to focus upon him the attention of the critics.
</p>

<p>
In 1849 Dostoevsky was arrested, with members of a radical organization,
on governmental charges of sedition. The terrible suffering
he sustained while awaiting his execution (he was first confined in
prison for eight months) have been set forth in striking passages of his
novels, <em>The Idiot</em> and <em>Letters from a Dead House</em>. The sentence of
death was finally, and very unexpectedly, commuted to one of imprisonment
in Siberia for four years. At the expiration of this period he
served perforce as a private soldier in the Russian army for three more
years. When he was permitted to return to St. Petersburg he was
accompanied by his first wife, whom he had loved and married while
in exile.
</p>

<p>
Dostoevsky&rsquo;s interminable suffering from epileptic seizures (it
has been suggested that these fits originated in a beating administered
to him by his father when Fyodor was a boy); his poverty, and the
constant accumulation of debt; the terrific haste with which he found
it necessary to write his most profound books&mdash;all have made it natural
to him, in dwelling upon any physiological aspect of his characters,
<a id="page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
to be as unconvincing as the eremite attempting an analysis of conditions
of sex life.
</p>

<p>
In short, Dostoevsky&rsquo;s nervous disorders pervaded his &ldquo;sensual
sense&rdquo; of beauty&mdash;of beauty in all its manifestations. At the same
time it must be remarked that this negation of physical responsiveness
surely intensified the acuteness of his mental vision, which was otherwise
refined emotionally by the results of his imprisonment and life-long
hardships. And this also explains why Dostoevsky&rsquo;s novels are
lacking so singularly in the tingle of the physical contact of his characters;
why the suffering of his men and women move us so profoundly;
why his writings are so uneven, his dialogues of such elemental
power, and his purely descriptive passages so ordinary.
</p>

<p>
The elemental power in his dialogues is due chiefly to the vigor
of action accredited his characters. In his work is not to be found the
picturesque phrase, the adroitly-turned period, the illuminating metaphor,
the sequence of construction, the tone or shading offered by the
commingling of his objects. Dostoevsky has no style of form, his outlines
are amorphous. It is in his power of transcribing the living voice,
of recording in never-failing reflex emotionalism the lives and deeds
of his startling figures that he is supreme.
</p>

<p>
If you have read one of his books you know much of what he
has to say. His other works are repetitions, mainly. For Dostoevsky
does not attempt to paint character, and rarely does he stop to show the
subtly-reacting influence of environment upon his men and women.
Always he is concerned with the idea of the individual&rsquo;s personal adjustments
to life. Each book of his throbs with the discordant elements
that clash over the establishment of this idea; and always its
conclusions are recognized. That is why I regard Dostoevsky as an
optimist. And his emphasis on humanity&rsquo;s spiritual conception of
life, no matter what the cost, grew more and more pronounced in his
later works.
</p>

<p>
His faith in human beings is expressed in one set theme, which
can be conveniently resolved into terms of comparison: on one hand
the individual&rsquo;s evasion of life&rsquo;s realities by the exercise of material
(and therefore fictitious) values; and on the other hand, the frank
acceptance of life&rsquo;s realities for the attainment of a proportionate spiritual
balance.
</p>

<p>
In <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, Dr. Raskolnikov is in doubt as to the
<a id="page-47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a>
ultimate worth of this attainment, until he expiates his crime in killing
the old moneylender (I forget her name) not by confessing,&mdash;Dostoevsky
is too fine a realist for that,&mdash;but by obtaining personal solace
from the regenerating qualities of his resignation. And it is characteristic
of our writer&rsquo;s method that Raskolnikov is assisted toward this
state of resignation by his love, Sonia, the prostitute, whose regard
for the murderer is based upon the confirmation evidenced in him of
the faith that has been stimulated in herself.
</p>

<p>
Similar in thesis, though expressed in terms of minor differences,
is Dostoevsky&rsquo;s last and unquestionably finest work, <em>The Brothers
Karamazov</em>. It is incomplete, actually one-third as long as he had intended
it to be. He died before he could finish the book. Nevertheless
it is compactly-formed material as the work now stands, and superior
to his other novels not because his outlines are more constrained,
his movement more co-ordinate, and the actual writing of a more intensive
quality, but because here he defines his own conception of spiritual
beauty in a distinctive fashion not to be found in his other books.
</p>

<p>
He offers us the history of a family,&mdash;and what a family! Each
figure in this domestic (?) group embodies conflicting phases of his
great idea. Fyodor Karamazov, the father, is a sensualist of the lowest
type imaginable. His three sons are Dmitri, Ivan, and Alyosha.
There is also another (illegitimate) son, Smerdyakov, an epileptic.
</p>

<p>
Dmitri Karamazov inherits his father&rsquo;s passion for wine, women,
and song, but the son&rsquo;s pursuit of this tame and conventional item is
tempered by frequent lapses, by periods of misgiving. The second son
is a materialist and a cynic. He changes his mind after a severe illness,
and his materialistic beliefs are all but supplanted by intense spiritual
curiosity. The third and youngest son is an idealist, lovable and loving.
Here again we have Dostoevsky&rsquo;s discordant elements conveyed
in terms of human characterizations. The plot of the story is as formless
as life itself, for it is with life, not with plots, that Dostoevsky deals.
</p>

<p>
Dmitri&rsquo;s hatred of his father is intensified by the rivalry that
exists between the two in their common pursuit of Grushenka&rsquo;s affections.
Grushenka is a woman of the demi-monde. The author, I
think, tried to draw her in lines that would reveal a physical zest of
life, as evidenced, for example, in Tolstoy&rsquo;s <em>Anna Karenina</em>. His failure
to make Grushenka a convincing individual, as an individual, is
typical, for the reasons I have already advanced.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
Development of the story shows how Dmitri&rsquo;s repeatedly avowed
determination to kill his father bears fruit. The elder Karamazov is
found dead one night, with his skull crushed. Dmitri is imprisoned.
And the rest of the book, which is devoted to Dmitri&rsquo;s trial, the moral
regeneration of Ivan, and the urge of life in Alyosha, approaches psychological
heights (or depths) that have not been surpassed to this day.
Small wonder that Nietzsche referred so affectionately to the &ldquo;giant
spirit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I have made reference to Dostoevsky&rsquo;s &ldquo;optimism.&rdquo; A better
word for it is faith&mdash;faith of a new high order. He is the most cheerful,
sunlight-giving writer in Russian literature. &ldquo;The essence of religious
feeling,&rdquo; says Prince Myshkin in <em>The Idiot</em>, &ldquo;does not come
under any sort of reasoning or atheism, and has nothing to do with
any crimes or misdemeanors.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Prince Myshkin is the central figure of the novel; he is the &ldquo;idiot,&rdquo;
and everybody abuses him. He is insulted and beaten, and robbed and
deceived and loved. He is the most singular figure in literature&mdash;he is
Dostoevsky himself.
</p>

<p>
But he is not an idiot in any sense. He is so profoundly simple
and wise, and has such great faith in human beings, that he is mistaken
by the men and women of ordinary passions as a fool. While he can
be readily toyed with by women&mdash;a significant phase of the writer&rsquo;s
own attitude toward the sex&mdash;Prince Myshkin is regarded by them
from a common basis of understanding. For them he holds no quality
of sex. &ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t know that, owing to my illness,&rdquo; he says
(he too is an epileptic), &ldquo;I know nothing of women.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It is in <em>The Idiot</em> that Dostoevsky&rsquo;s women are at least life-like.
The Epanchin sisters, especially the youngest, Aglaia, are not &ldquo;types&rdquo;
in the usual sense, but preconceived studies. The pages devoted to
Aglaia&rsquo;s love affair with Prince Myshkin are of the happiest in the
book.
</p>

<p>
Besides the books I have already mentioned, the more important
works are <em>The Possessed</em>, in which national politics play a large part;
<em>Poor Folk</em>, the story of a poor clerk&rsquo;s love for a poor woman who
eventually turns from him; and <em>Letters from a Dead House</em>. This last
is a book of personal experiences, and reveals Dostoevsky&rsquo;s relations
with the criminals with whom he was imprisoned in Siberia. The mental
temper of men who disregard and break the common and social
<a id="page-49" class="pagenum" title="49"></a>
laws, is set forth with the passionate curiosity that lies behind all his
probings of the human soul. I am strongly tempted to offer quotations;
to show, in this passage or that, how deeply Dostoevsky looked into the
most extreme boundaries of human sensibilities; but on the whole
extracts from his writings would do more harm than good. His work
is so disconnected, though not in any sense detached, that extracts
could not serve here to indicate the amazing clarity of his vision.
</p>

<p>
His books arouse a feeling of wonder that there can be so many
things in our own individual emotions with which we never before
came into contact. He moves us so profoundly because he tears his
men and women out of their morally-bound lives and makes them
confront stupendous questions&mdash;the questions of life. He plies detail
upon detail of human misery until one feels that the whole world is
reeling from him&mdash;then grows aware of the sweet white glow of Dostoevsky&rsquo;s
faith, and feels that life can hold no terrors&mdash;that he is above
the petty miseries of human strife! That is why I say Dostoevsky&rsquo;s
optimism is of the new high order.
</p>

<p>
Dostoevsky purges one&rsquo;s mind. He makes you conscious of the
beauty of a soul.

AN UNREELING REALIST
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>The Titan</em>, by Theodore Dreiser
[John Lane Company, New York]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">heodore</span> Dreiser possesses none of the standard qualifications
for the art of fiction writing. He is not imaginative but
inventive; he is not clever but clear; he is not excited but calm. Whatever
the flaws in his considerable body of work no fair-minded reader
may say that it is made to catch popular applause. Its tremendous
distinction is sincerity. Another characteristic which his novels exhibit
<a id="page-50" class="pagenum" title="50"></a>
is resolute purpose. Dreiser is aiming at something, and in <em>The
Titan</em>, the second book in an unfinished trilogy, he takes a long if
wobbly step toward it. Previously to the publishing of this volume
he had not even hinted at what he intended to work out. One thing
was certain: he was not a trifler; he was not trying to write best
sellers; literary success was not in his mind. He had set out seriously
and indefatigably to write, not so much what he felt and thought,
as what he saw. Some day he would try to get at the realities that lay
back of their representations. He would probably undertake to reveal
the soul of the American nation. He would pass through the
growth stages of a nation, and achieve some kind of spiritual national
life. In the last two pages of <em>The Titan</em> this guess at his purpose
receives appreciable encouragement. Moreover, it is made evident
for the first time, in these concluding paragraphs, that Dreiser&rsquo;s
prosaic realism springs not only from a vague, deep idealism but a
large, hidden spirituality. For at the core of him Dreiser is a profoundly
religious person.
</p>

<p>
Neither his style nor his stuff is far above the dead level of
mediocrity; in fact, Dreiser&rsquo;s rhetoric is often inexcusably atrocious&mdash;intentionally
crude, one is tempted to assert. Obviously he is not
interested in style; he is conscious of something bigger than that revealing
itself in a huge, ugly, unfinished moving picture&mdash;a net result
symbolical of a young, raw, riotous, unsynthesized national life.
One is therefore tempted to say that Dreiser, more than any other
author, is the personification of America. He represents the composite
personality of Uncle Sam.
</p>

<p>
After reading <em>The Financier</em> and running far into the interminable
pages of <em>The Titan</em> I felt that in the absence of cameras, kodaks,
Baedekers, and historians Dreiser would be worth while. His endless
reels of pictorial facts did not impress me as possessing sufficient
animation successfully to compete with these odd rivals, but I admired
his consistent sincerity and simplicity and felt that something
important was promised by the mere unfinishedness of his pictures.
I was sure that he did not write as one inspired, and certainly not as
one fired. And after finishing <em>The Titan</em> I felt that here was a work
having the aspects of a seriously performed duty, exacted by fidelity
to some personal theory of industrial change. I could not imagine
the author happy as an artist is happy in his creative work; he was
<a id="page-51" class="pagenum" title="51"></a>
too conscious of service to a cause. But in the last paragraph I discovered
a big, personal note which introduced an attitude that extends
beyond the borders of materialism. It presented another
Dreiser&mdash;an author who was much more than a cinematograph,
snapping superficial impressions of a vast panorama. Two years ago
I should not have attributed the following words to Theodore Dreiser:

<em>The Titan</em>, by virtue of its bold, graphic strokes, loses its identity

THE REVOLT OF THE &ldquo;ONCE BORN&rdquo;
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Challenge</em>, by Louis Untermeyer.
[The Century Company, New York]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
There has recently appeared a volume of verse by Louis Untermeyer
which is an excellent example of the determinedly young
and eupeptic philosophy so prevalent today&mdash;the philosophy of revolt.
The book is named <em>Challenge</em> and as challenge it must be considered.
To be sure it is rhymed, but the fact seems quite incidental.
To rhyme a polemic does not make it poetry, and one feels sure that
Mr. Untermeyer is more proud of the spiritual attitude than of the
artistry.
</p>

<p>
The book is a revolt, but a careful perusal of its pages fails to
reveal against what it revolts. At first glance one might think it
socialistic, but it is not clearly enough visualized for that. Socialism
has at least found the enemy. Mr. Untermeyer manfully girds on
his armor and sets forth to war, shouting his challenge lustily the
while. And why, after all, be particular about having an actual enemy?
Life, with a capital L, can do duty for that, or &ldquo;the scornful
<a id="page-52" class="pagenum" title="52"></a>
and untroubled skies,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;cold complacency of earth.&rdquo; The revolt
is the point, and Mr. Untermeyer drives it home with all the
phrases of frozen impetuosity to be discovered in a very useful vocabulary.
&ldquo;Athletic courage,&rdquo; &ldquo;eager night,&rdquo; &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s lusty banner,&rdquo;
&ldquo;impetuous winds,&rdquo; &ldquo;raging mirth,&rdquo; etc., are scattered carefully
through the pages. But unfortunately, virility&mdash;with all due respect
to the reviewer who mentioned these poems in the June number of
The Little Review&mdash;has a way of oozing out of such phrases, leaving
them empty of everything save a painful determination to be manly at
all costs.
</p>

<p>
But though Mr. Untermeyer is not quite clear on some subjects
he is very clear on others. Several things seem to have struck him
with peculiar force&mdash;that city streets are dirty, for instance; that strife
is tonic for young blood; and that it is difficult for the human soul
to conceive of complete annihilation. These things he proclaims passionately
and challenges the world to disprove them. A little couplet
from Kipling&rsquo;s <em>Jungle Book</em> suggests itself rather maliciously as the
probable attitude of the world towards this outbreak:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">&ldquo;There is none like to me!&rdquo; says the Cub in the pride of his earliest kill;</p>
      <p class="verse">But the Jungle is large and the Cub he is small. Let him think and be still.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
Seriously, however, Mr. Untermeyer&rsquo;s attitude is what William
James calls the attitude of the &ldquo;once born.&rdquo; One feels that he thinks
in one dimension, that he does not see around his subject, nor hear
the overtones which surround every happening for a man of deep intellect.
The revolt is Walt Whitman&rsquo;s magnificent revolt, which is
overpowering in a giant, cropping out in a man of very ordinary
stature, where it sits a little ridiculously.
</p>

<p>
As philosophy much of this, printed on a neat little card, would
do splendidly to hang in a business office for the encouragement of
the employees. As poetry it is negligible. Mr. Untermeyer lacks
entirely the one gift which could redeem it&mdash;the gift of poignancy.
This lack is particularly striking in the middle section, called <em>Interludes</em>,
in which he pauses for a little from revolt. These are love songs
and lyrics, a field in which anything not perfect is no longer acceptable.
And Mr. Untermeyer&rsquo;s are not perfect. His sense of rhythm
is extremely primitive and his lyrics are full of words. Only now and
then, when he forgets for a moment how manly he is, does he say
<a id="page-53" class="pagenum" title="53"></a>
anything simply enough to strike home. These lines, for instance,
from <em>Irony</em> stick:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">There is no kind of death to kill</p>
      <p class="verse">the sands that lie so meek and still ...</p>
      <p class="verse">But man is great and strong and wise&mdash;</p>
                    <p class="verse7">And so he dies.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
But in the main it is unfortunate that Mr. Untermeyer, who
writes so much and so readably on the subject of poetry, should put
out so pretentious and undeveloped a volume as this is. It is inevitable
that it should affect his standing as a critic, and there seems little
doubt that his work in that field is really valuable to the cause of poetry
in America today.

When I think of Paul Verlaine I invariably recall Oscar Wilde,
despite or because of the abysmal dissimilarity of the two personalities.
The sincere, ingenuous, all-loving child Paul, and the thoroughly artificial,
paradoxical Oscar; the typical Bohemian with the criminal-face
like that of Dostoevsky, and the salon-idol, the refined and gorgeous
bearer of the sun-flower. Fate had somewhat reconciled the two contrasts.
Both had been &ldquo;sinners,&rdquo; both were condemned by society and
imprisoned, both had &ldquo;repented&rdquo;&mdash;one in <em>De Profundis</em> where the
haughty humility of the self-enamored artist stirs us with its artificial
beauty; the other in the primitive-Christian&mdash;nay, Catholic&mdash;<em>Sagesse</em>:

<p class="noindent">
Some months ago in reviewing Edmond Lepelletier&rsquo;s voluminous
book, (<em>Paul Verlaine: His Life and Work</em>) I remarked that the Poet of
Absinthe and Violets was still awaiting his Boswell. My view has not
changed after reading Wilfrid Thorley&rsquo;s monograph on Verlaine; but
my wish for an adequate biography of the signer of <em>Romances sans
Paroles</em> has now become counterbalanced by an earnest prayer that the
memory of the poet may be saved from such indelicate manipulators
as Mr. Thorley. Why this respectable Englishman should have attempted
to treat the life of the most wayward French poet since Villon
can be explained by no other reason than that it was a case of &ldquo;made to
order.&rdquo; When a Velasquez is pierced by a fanatical suffragette the
whole civilized world is roused to indignation; but when an honest
philistine unceremoniously puffs his cheap smoke into the face of a
dead poet there is not a single protest against that sort of vandalism.
Fear of the editor&rsquo;s blue pencil restrains me from putting my attitude
more outspokenly.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-55" class="pagenum" title="55"></a>
A conscientious compilator would have found sufficient material
for an unpretentious sketch of the life of Verlaine and for an appreciation
of his works. Lepelletier gives an amazing mass of facts and
personal reminiscences (you may ignore his naive interpretations);
Arthur Symons in <em>The Symbolist Movement in Literature</em> has a masterpiece
essay on Verlaine, not to mention a number of other French
and English writers who have given us glimpses of the imperceptible
image of the poet&mdash;writers who <em>knew what they were taking about</em>.
Mr. Thorley has made use of various sources, but in a peculiar way.
He fished out the anecdotal scraps, the piquant details, the filthy hints,
and patched up a caricature-portrait of a lewd, perverse &ldquo;undesirable,&rdquo;
whose poetry (I quote reluctantly) &ldquo;was born solely of the genitals,&rdquo;
whose &ldquo;life is but the trite old story of the emotions developed at the
expense of domestic peace and civic order; of art for art&rsquo;s sake made
to condone the manner of its begetting, and the trend of its appeal;
of the hushed acquiescence in emotion as a sacred thing, whatever the
quality of the impulse from which it ripens or the level of ideas on
which it feeds.&rdquo; Out of the ninety-odd pages of stuff seventy-nine are
devoted to &ldquo;biography&rdquo; sufficiently spicy to make any toothless old
rake chuckle; the rest is given over to &ldquo;criticism&rdquo;&mdash;a mutilated
melange of some of the views of Symons, George Moore, and others,
flavored with the compilator&rsquo;s own commonplaces. I quote from the
closing lines:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
A specious and high-sounding phrase has been invented to excuse the
perversities of imaginative genius by speaking of its achievement as a &ldquo;conquest
of new realms for the spirit.&rdquo; But the worth of such acquisitions depends
on the nature of the territory, and if it be, morally, a malarial swamp
conducive only to a human type found subversive in our normal world, it will
always appear to the English mind that we shall do well to forego the new
kingdom and to withhold our homage from its discoverer.... That
&ldquo;nice is nasty, nasty nice,&rdquo; and the creative artist the sole arbiter, must be
hotly opposed so long as a social conscience survives.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
And this was written in Anno Domini 1914!
</p>

<p>
A sense of fairness urges me to rehabilitate the &ldquo;English mind&rdquo;
by recalling a passage from Mr. Thorley&rsquo;s compatriot, Arthur Symons:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
The artist, it cannot be too clearly understood, has no more part in society
than a monk in domestic life: he cannot be judged by its rules, he can
be neither praised nor blamed for his acceptance or rejection of its conventions.
Social rules are made by normal people for normal people, and the
man of genius is fundamentally abnormal.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
<a id="page-56" class="pagenum" title="56"></a>
It is high time that this axiom became a truism and that we cease
to measure the artist with the yard-stick of conventional morality.
&ldquo;L&rsquo;art, mes enfants, c&rsquo;est d&rsquo;être absolument soi-même,&rdquo; sang Verlaine,
and somewhere else he reveals a bit of that self with his usual sincerity:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
I believe, and I sin in thought as in action; I believe, and I repent in
thought, if no more. Or again, I believe, and I am a good Christian at this
moment; I believe, and I am a bad Christian the instant after. The remembrance,
the hope, the invocation of a sin delights me, with or without remorse,
sometimes under the very form of sin, and hedged with all its natural consequences....
This delight ... it pleases us to put to paper
and publish more or less well expressed: we consign it, in short, into literary
form, forgetting all religious ideas, or not letting one of them escape us. Can
any one in good faith condemn us as poets? A hundred times no.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;And, indeed, I should echo, a hundred times no!&rdquo; exclaims the
Englishman, Arthur Symons.
</p>

<p>
I cannot resist the temptation of quoting the happiest definition
of Verlaine&rsquo;s personality written by Charles Morice back in 1888:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
The soul of an immortal child, that is the soul of Verlaine, with all the
privileges and all the perils of so being: with the sudden despair so easily distracted,
the vivid gaieties without a cause, the excessive suspicions and the
excessive confidences, the whims so easily outwearied, the deaf and blind infatuations,
with, especially, the unceasing renewal of impressions in the incorruptible
integrity of personal vision and sensation. Years, influences, teachings,
may pass over a temperament such as this, may irritate it, may fatigue
it; transform it, never&mdash;never so much as to alter that particular unity which
consists in a dualism, in the division of forces between the longing after what
is evil and the adoration of what is good; or rather, in the antagonism of spirit
and flesh....
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
I have not mentioned the most striking &ldquo;feature&rdquo; of Mr. Thorley&rsquo;s
... production&mdash;the appendix. Six of Verlaine&rsquo;s poems are
translated by him for the benefit of those who do not understand
French &ldquo;intimately.&rdquo; &ldquo;To offer them to other readers, would, of
course, be an impertinence,&rdquo; he modestly admits. Impertinence is not
the word for that outrage. I have experienced physical pain at the
sight of the Hunnish sacrilege committed by this well-wishing moralist.
The poet, for whom &ldquo;De la musique avant toute chose; De la musique
encore et toujours!&rdquo; who had pleaded, &ldquo;Car nous voulons la nuance
encore,
Pas la <a id="corr-32"></a>couleur, rien que la nuance!&rdquo; has been mercilessly crucified
in the form of quasi-Tennysonian, taffy-like verses. One recalls
with gratitude the careful albeit pale translations of Gertrude Hall, who
at least had the sense of æsthetic propriety in endeavoring to remain
true to the master&rsquo;s meter and rhythm.

From Tolstoy&rsquo;s diary in 1855:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">

... a great, a stupendous idea, to the realization of which I feel
myself capable of devoting all my life. The idea is the foundation of a new
religion corresponding to the development of mankind&mdash;<em>the religion of Jesus,
but purified from dogma and mysticism; a practical religion, not promising bliss in future,
but giving happiness on earth</em>.... To work consciously
for <em>the union on earth</em> by religion....

There was a time when I tried to change my position which was not in
harmony with my conscience, but the conditions created by the past, by my
family and its claims upon me, were so complicated that I did not know how
to free myself. I had not the strength. Now that I am over eighty and have
become feeble I have given up trying to free myself. Strange to say, as my
feebleness increases I realize more and more strongly the wrongfulness of my
position, and it grows more and more intolerable to me.

Tolstoy&rsquo;s failure was inevitable, for he had approached life with
the uncompromising logic of a child or a god. For fifty years he
preached his religion, and during all that time he remained splendidly
inconsistent. He opposed private property and proceeded to live on
his estate; he had denounced marriage and was a father to thirteen
children. Notwithstanding his deadly hatred for the Russian government,
he bitterly denounced the liberals and the revolutionists for their
&ldquo;un-Christian&rdquo; ways of fighting the enemy; but his greatest contradiction,
to the joy of the intellectual world, consisted in the victory of
the artist over the moralist as manifested in his numerous novels and
plays.
</p>

<p>
The work of Edward Garnett is conscientious and is, to my knowledge,
the best short biography of Tolstoy. It was a happy idea to
discard the traditional portrait and use a reproduction of Kramskoy&rsquo;s
painting, which dates back to the sixties, if I am not mistaken. It is
when looking at this portrait, a great piece of art in itself, that we
envisage the author of <em>War and Peace</em>. A few words from the description
of Tolstoy&rsquo;s face by P. A. Terzeyeonvo:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
His face was a true peasant&rsquo;s face: simple, rustic, with a broad nose, a
weather-beaten skin, and thick overhanging brows, from beneath which small,
keen, grey eyes peered sharply forth.... One instantly divines in Tolstoy
<a id="page-58" class="pagenum" title="58"></a>
a man of the highest society&mdash;with polished, unconstrained manners.
</p>

<p>
... On the one hand an insatiable thirst for power over people, and
on the other an unconquerable ardor for inward purity and the sweetness of
meekness....
</p>

<p>
In this chain of seething, imperious instincts linked with delicate spiritual
organization lies the profound tragicness of Tolstoy&rsquo;s personality.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Mr. Garnett succeeds in giving the quintessence of Tolstoy&rsquo;s
works and teachings in less than a hundred pages. Like most of the
Russian&rsquo;s eulogistic biographers, Mr. Garnett has not escaped the fallacy
of exaggerating the moral power that Tolstoy exercised over the
government. To say that the Czar and his ministers &ldquo;dared not touch&rdquo;
the outspoken anarchist and heretic &ldquo;out of dread of Europe&mdash;nay, of
Russia,&rdquo; is to reveal one&rsquo;s ignorance of the brazen defiance displayed
by Muscovite autocrats in regard to public opinion. As the Germans
put it: &ldquo;Herr Kossack, schämen Sie sich!&rdquo; Tolstoy, as a matter of
fact, had helped to check the revolutionary spirit of his compatriots in
a greater degree than the tyrannic persecutions of Von-Plehve. Had
he not appealed time and again to embrace his doctrine of Non-Resistance?
Had he not denounced the revolutionists as violent prototypes
of their hangers? Could the government see any danger in a man who
wrote in <em>The Times</em> during the revolution of 1905: &ldquo;To free oneself
from the government it is only necessary to abstain from participating
in it and supporting it. Our consciousness of the law of God demands
from us only one thing: moral self-perfection, i. e., the liberation of
oneself from all those weaknesses and vices which make one the slave
of governments and the participation in their crimes&rdquo;? Another tragic
contradiction of the restless soul of the anarchist who, despite himself,
renders aid to the despots.

INTROSPECTION
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Chance</em>, by Joseph Conrad.
[Doubleday, Page &amp; Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Did you ever take supper in the apartments of a dear bachelor
friend, on a night when the wind howled outside the window, and the
rain beat against the pane? And after the satisfying meal, whose
<a id="page-59" class="pagenum" title="59"></a>
perfect appointment made you forget all save the luxury of living,
did you retire to the spacious living room, and after accepting an
aromatic Havana, stretch your feet out to the crackling log fire, and
as the smoke from your cigar crawled upward listen to the philosophical
analyses of your cultured host on that marvelously simple and
profoundly complex servant and master of man, the human mind?
Of such an evening is the atmosphere of <em>Chance</em>. Not academically
deep, but deep from the standpoint of a full life and an active intelligence.
</p>

<p>
Everyone loves to analyze his fellow creatures. Some do it well,
some do it badly, but we all do it. Conrad does it masterfully. There
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a type which holds a mystery for him. The village
pillar; the frail, ill-fated maid; the buxsom housewife; the silent
captain ashore and afloat; the opinionated, retired old gentleman;
the cynical, good-natured man of thirty-five; the flat, tintless
fraud. Into the mental realm of all these he makes expeditions long
and short. His characters live. They mingle good and bad, and, as
strong characters should, weave for themselves a charming story of
love, adventure, trial, and victory, never trite, and always surprising.
It is a tale built of character studies and garnished with odd conjective
philosophy.
</p>

<div class="excerpt">

Our new acquaintance paused, then added meditatively:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Queer man. As if it made any difference. Queer man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly unwise to admit any sort of responsibility for our actions,
whose consequences we are never able to foresee,&rdquo; remarked Marlow by way
of assent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The consequence of his action was that I got a ship,&rdquo; said the other.
&ldquo;That could not do much harm,&rdquo; he added with a laugh which argued a
probably unconscious contempt of general ideas.
</p>

<p>
But Marlow was not put off. He was patient and reflective. He had
been at sea many years and I verily believe he liked sea-life because upon
the whole it is favourable to reflection. I am speaking of the now nearly
vanished sea-life under sail. To those who may be surprised at the statement
I will point out that this life secured for the mind of him who embraced
it the inestimable advantages of solitude and silence. Marlow had the habit
of pursuing general ideas in a peculiar manner, between jest and earnest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that your namesake, Mr. Powell,
the Shipping Master, had done you much harm. Such was hardly his intention.
And even if it had been he would not have had the power. He was but
a man, and the incapacity to achieve anything distinctly good or evil is inherent
in our earthly condition. Mediocrity is our mark. And perhaps it&rsquo;s just as
well, since, for the most part, we cannot be certain of the effect of our
actions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about the effect,&rdquo; the other stood up to Marlow manfully.
<a id="page-60" class="pagenum" title="60"></a>
&ldquo;What effect did you expect anyhow? I tell you he did something
uncommonly kind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He did what he could,&rdquo; Marlow retorted gently, &ldquo;and on his own showing
that was not a very great deal. I cannot help thinking that there was
some malice in the way he seized the opportunity to serve you. He managed
to make you uncomfortable. You wanted to go to sea, but he jumped
on the chance of accommodating your desire with a vengeance. I am inclined
to think your cheek alarmed him. And this was an excellent occasion
to suppress you altogether. For if you accepted he was relieved of you with
every appearance of humanity, and if you made objections (after requesting
his assistance, mind you) it was open to him to drop you as a sort of impostor.
You might have had to decline that berth for some very valid
reason. From sheer necessity, perhaps. The notice was too uncommonly
short. But under the circumstances you&rsquo;d have covered yourself with ignominy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Our new friend knocked the ashes out of his pipe.

<p class="noindent">
There is something about Conrad which gives a warm feeling
about the heart. A certain fineness of humor, a certain fullness of
sympathy. He never mixes his similes; they always take the same
tone and the same color. For instance:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
I took a piece of cake and went out to bribe the Fyne dog into some
sort of self-control. His sharp, comical yapping was unbearable, like stabs
through one&rsquo;s brain, and Fyne&rsquo;s deeply modulated remonstrances abashed
the vivacious animal no more than the deep, patient murmur of the sea abashes
a nigger minstrel on a popular beach. Fyne was beginning to swear at him
in low, sepulchral tones when I appeared. The dog became at once wildly
demonstrative, half-strangling himself in his collar, his eyes and tongue hanging
out in the excess of his uncomprehensible affection for me. This was
before he caught sight of the cake in my hand. A series of vertical springs
high up in the air followed, and then, when he got the cake, he instantly
lost his interest in everything else.

AN AMERICAN NOVEL
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Clark&rsquo;s Field</em>, by Robert Herrick.
[Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It was but the other day that Mr. Herrick told us what he thought
about the American novel. Those who read the trenchant article
found not only a criticism of our machine-like fictionists and their
half-baked methods, but also a sturdy conviction that the day was
surely approaching when we should demand and receive a truer and
<a id="page-61" class="pagenum" title="61"></a>
more vital presentation of our national life in our literature. And if
Mr. Herrick, long since tagged an apostate to our national creed of
turgid optimism, believes this, we can safely trust to his cool vision and
be glad that the tide has turned. The rich human material lies ready
at hand, and the audience is fast growing intelligent and discriminating.
As yet, however, &ldquo;we await the writer or writers keen enough
to perceive the opportunity, powerful enough to interest the public in
what it has been unwilling to heed, and of course endowed with sufficient
insight to comprehend our big new world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Whatever may be said for our other novelists, surely not one of
them can exhibit a mingling of the powers of insight and artistry equal
to that of Robert Herrick. His work from the beginning has been an
honest and incisive attempt to interpret our life in its peculiar and
universal aspects, in spite of the clamor of the public at his tearing
away of the veils of sentimentality and prudery. The errors into
which he fell were due to the ardor of his spiritual vision, which drove
him into an impassioned taking of sides. He has emerged from that
stage into what his critics call his &ldquo;old manner,&rdquo; a more objective
treatment of his material. But in the process of change something
was lost&mdash;the element of flaming intensity which gave the reader a
similar capacity to feel. In this latest performance, as well as in <em>One
Woman&rsquo;s Life</em>, he is always cool, clear-sighted, and admirably efficient
in the task he sets himself; but never passionate. On the contrary,
despite the pervading atmosphere of earnestness, he often assumes a
playful satiric tone, mordant but not bitter,&mdash;a method well suited to
his matter and purpose.
</p>

<p>
<em>Clark&rsquo;s Field</em> tells the story of the influence of property upon the
human beings who own it and hope to reap gold from its increasing
value. All that is left of the great Clark farm is a fifty-acre field in a
growing New England town, bequeathed jointly to the two brothers,
Edward and Samuel, the former of whom has emigrated to the West
and wholly disappeared from the ken of his relatives. So at first the
tale is of the baleful influence of expectation delayed again and again:
in the case of Samuel who cannot sell the land because of his brother&rsquo;s
half-interest, and who in consequence sinks into a sodden inertia; in
his son&rsquo;s disintegration into a lazy and drunken &ldquo;Vet&rdquo;; in his sister
Addie&rsquo;s sordid and pathetic sally into life resulting in the birth of another
human being destined to taste of the fruit of their tree and to find
it, one day, very bitter.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-62" class="pagenum" title="62"></a>
The greater portion of the novel, then, deals with the influence of
the realized wealth upon the unformed, colorless little girl, Adelle, the
last of the Clarks. It is a masterly piece of work&mdash;the gradual development
of the pale rooming-house drudge into the silly and insolent
woman of fashion, and slowly but certainly into a human being with a
soul. Less promising stuff for a heroine neither fate nor Mr. Herrick
could have chosen; the latter delights in ample admissions throughout
the book of Adelle&rsquo;s lack of beauty, brains, and charm. Yet he is always
sufficiently temperate to escape the danger of caricature. Adelle is a
convincing figure. The slow dawning upon her consciousness of the
power of money, her &ldquo;magic lamp&rdquo; which she need only rub to gratify
any desire, is followed by swift and constant use of the new weapon.
It brings her a fresh assurance, a few scatter-brained friends, some
stylish clothes, and, at length, a callow youth for a husband. It never
brings her contact with a real person or friendship with a stimulating
individual; nor can it save her from the failure of her marriage, nor
compensate her for the death of her little boy.
</p>

<p>
Adelle&rsquo;s story, then, turns out to be what we least expected it,&mdash;a
hopeful one. It leaves us with almost a sense of security, for is she
not one of those who can &ldquo;derive good from her mistakes,&rdquo; and therefore
&ldquo;the safest sort of human being to raise in this garden plot of
souls&rdquo;? And although we are still saddled with &ldquo;that absurd code of
inheritance and property rights that the Anglo-Saxon peoples have
preserved from their ancient tribal days in the gloomy forests of
the lower Rhine,&rdquo; the situation is not without hope, since it has yielded
a man of the judge&rsquo;s type, in whom the beauty of a past idealism is
coupled with the freshness of a new vision of responsibility.
</p>

<p>
To hark back to the recent article in <em>The Yale Review</em>, we believe
that Mr. Herrick himself has given us an American novel&mdash;thoroughly
American in situation, character, treatment, and even in philosophy.
We, as a people, are beginning to suspect our boastful optimism
as we become aware of the sordidness beneath the fair exterior of our
glorious civilization. And in accordance with the western temperament,
the awareness of wrong leads not to bitter cynicism but to sturdy
efforts toward amelioration. Such, then, is the spirit of <em>Clark&rsquo;s Field</em>&mdash;a
hopefulness in the power of courage, and labor, and a growing
sense of social responsibility to move mounds that seem to have become
immovable mountains through a tenacious fostering of tradition.

THE &ldquo;SAVAGE&rdquo; PAINTERS
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Cubists and Post Impressionism</em>, by Arthur Jerome Eddy.
[A. C. McClurg and Company, Chicago.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
An attempt to explain the new schools in art &ldquo;in plain, every-day
terms.&rdquo; An earnest appeal for tolerance in regard to seemingly perversive
forms. The book has a wealth of material and numerous quotations
from Picasso, Picabia, Cézanne, Matisse, and others, considerably
more interesting and instructive than Mr. Eddy&rsquo;s own truisms.
Although the author repeatedly resents any accusation in his adherence
to Cubism, the reader gets the impression that the Cubistic movement
has received a more thorough and fair treatment than the other
new schools. Of the sixty-nine reproductions of Post-Impressionistic
paintings and sculpture, only five represent the Futurists. Idillon
Redon, who gave us the greater delight in last year&rsquo;s International
Exhibition, is totally ignored. Among the Self-Portraits that of Matisse
is sorely missed&mdash;a work that helps greatly in understanding the quaint
painter of the Woman in Red Madras. Whether Mr. Eddy will succeed
in convincing the prejudiced conservatives is doubtful; but in those
who have appreciated the daring attempts of the new schools his book
will arouse a renewed longing for the foreign &ldquo;savages&rdquo; and an ardent
hope for their further invasions in our &ldquo;sane and healthful&rdquo; galleries.

Galsworthy, Stanley Houghton, Githa Sowerby, Yeats, Lenox Robinson, T. G.
Murray, Tolstoy, Tchekhof, Gorki, and Andreyev, outlining the plays of each
and emphasizing their relation to the problem of modern society. She is
the interpreter here rather than the propagandist, and her interpretations are
not academic discourses. They give you the plays partly by quotation, partly
in crisp narrative, and they are not the kind of interpretations that make
the authors wish they had never written plays. Whether you like Emma
Goldman or not, you will get a more compact and comprehensive working-knowledge
of the modern drama from her book than from any other recent
compilation we know of.

A CHANGE OF PRICE
</h2>

</div>

<p>
With the August issue, the sixth month of our very flourishing
life, we have decided to make one important change in <em>The Little Review</em>.
We are reducing the subscription price to $1.50 a year, and that
of single copies to 15 cents. There will be no change in size or appearance.
Those whose subscriptions have already been paid on the
former basis will be continued for another half year.
</p>

<p>
Our reason for doing so is this: We have discovered that a great
many of the people whom we wish to reach cannot afford to pay $2.50
a year for a magazine. It happens that we are very emphatic about
wanting these people in our audience, and we believe they are as
sincerely interested in <em>The Little Review</em> as we are stimulated by having
them among our readers. Therefore we are going to become more
accessible.
</p>

<p>
With characteristic lack of modesty we wish also to make another
announcement. Our success so far has exceeded even our own
hopes&mdash;and it may be remembered that they were rather high. As for
our practical friends who warned us against starting a literary magazine,
even their dark prophecies of debt and a speedy demise have had
to dissolve before our statements that we have paid our bills with what
<em>The Little Review</em> has earned in its six months of existence, that we
are free of debt, that we even have money in the bank, and a subscription
list that acts like a live thing!
</p>

<p>
But we want more! We want everyone who might like <em>The
Little Review</em> to hear about it. Therefore:
</p>

<p>
We want interested readers to be interested to the point of bringing
in others. We want intelligent spokesmen in every city in the
country to tell people about the magazine and to get their subscriptions.
Anyone sending in three yearly subscriptions will be given a
year&rsquo;s subscription free. Or he may make a commission of 33 1-3
per cent on every subscription he gets. College girls ought to find the
field a very workable one during their summer vacations. Every ten
subscriptions will mean $5.00 to the energetic young woman who pursues
her friends with accounts of <em>The Little Review&rsquo;s</em> value and charm.
</p>

<p>
We are trying to make a magazine that is unacademic, enthusiastic,
appreciative and critical in the real sense; that seeks and
emphasizes the beauty which is truth and insists upon a larger naturalness
and a nobler seriousness in art and in life. We know there is
room for such a magazine and we ask you to help us in advertising it.

of 500 copies and was practically sold out before January 1, 1913. The late Dr. Weir
Mitchell in a letter to the owner of the copyright said among other things: &ldquo;Certainly
no more beautiful piece of English has been printed of late years.&rdquo; And again: &ldquo;May
I ask if this lady did not leave other literary products? The one you print is so unusual
in style and quality and imagination that after I read it I felt convinced there must be
other matter of like character.&rdquo;

To the lover of what may be called spiritual autobiography, perhaps no other book in
recent English literature appeals with so potent a charm as &ldquo;The Private Papers of
Henry Ryecroft.&rdquo; It is the highest expression of Gissing&rsquo;s genius&mdash;a book that deserves
a place on the same shelf with the Journals of De Guérin and Amiel. For the
present publication, the numerous passages of the &ldquo;Papers&rdquo; relating to books and reading
have been brought together and given an external setting appropriate to their exquisite
literary flavor.

Nancy the Joyous<br />
A Novel of pure Delight
</p>

<p class="narrow">
&ldquo;<em>Here, at the bend of the road I stop to wave,
and to play you a gay little snatch of tune on
my pipes, like any other true gypsy.</em>&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Nancy.</em>
</p>

<p>
Nancy the Joyous is a simple little story&mdash;simple and
clean and true&mdash;like a ray of sunshine in a bleak corner;
like a wind-and-rain-and-sun-bathed flower on a steep mountainside.
It is a story of sentiment, but without weak sentimentality,
without tears, a kind of &ldquo;salt-of-the-earth&rdquo; optimism.
</p>

<p>
¶ Brisk with the air of the Tennessee mountains, where Nancy finds the
&ldquo;true values of life,&rdquo; and warm with the joy of living and loving and laughing,
here is a &ldquo;character&rdquo; story&mdash;a &ldquo;heart interest&rdquo; story&mdash;a &ldquo;local color&rdquo;
story of a picturesque locality&mdash;and yet a straightforward, unpretentious romance
whose charm is based on more than mere uniqueness of characters or
setting. Nancy is buoyant with life itself. Nancy is a real girl, a likable girl,
and the love she inspires in her fellow creatures of the story is a real affection
that shines outside the pages of the book and seizes hold of the heart of the
reader.
</p>

<p>
A delightful book to read. An ideal book to give to a friend.
</p>

<p class="s narrow">
<em>The make-up of the book is in keeping with the story. A
frontispiece in cheerful colors of Nancy herself; each chapter
has a specially drawn initial; each cheery letter has a full-width
pictorial heading. Bound in extra cloth; decorated cover, with
ornaments in gold. Pictorial jacket in full color and gold.

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&trade; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&trade; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
